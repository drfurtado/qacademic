Students will be introduced to concepts such as reliability, validity, measures of central tendency, variability, probability, and statistical techniques including: t tests (independent & dependent samples), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Chi-square, correlation, and regression. Students are expected to take the material/concepts presented in class and apply them through a series of homework assignments and quizzes. The overall goal of the course is not only to help students understand the mathematical/statistical concepts presented but also to assist in the application of these procedures."

See the policy on protesting a grade in the syllabus. These e-mails tend to be expressive utility on the part of the student and do not require a response from me. Students interested in improving their knowledge of material should see me during office hours.\nThe student is requesting an extension on an assignment for which the syllabus already established the deadline. The answer is always “no”; unless you have a reason that can be documented and you contacted me before the deadline.\nThe student is asking for an extra credit opportunity, a request that amounts to more grading for the professor. The answer is “no”.\n\nMore e-mail stuff…\n\nIf you need to schedule an online meeting via Zoom (https://csun.zoom.us/), you can do so by visiting this link: http://calendly.com/drfurtado.

Any student engaging in academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism) is subject to discipline, which may include a failing grade in the course, and may also be subject to more severe discipline by the University. Students are encouraged to visit the link below and become familiar with the Standards for Student Conduct.\nhttp://www.csun.edu/a&r/soc/studentconduct.html\n\nReflection Paper Submission\nPlagiarism is a serious violation of the CSUN Student Conduct Code. Be aware that borrowing a paper from a student who completed this course previously and writing your paper based on that student’s paper will be considered PLAGIARISM.\n\nTurnitin (see below) will detect such misconducts as it checks every submission against a database of papers, as well as against the Internet.\n\n\nPenalties: If caught, the student will receive a letter grade of “F” on BOTH the Reflection Paper and the Video Performance assignments, in which case the student will likely fail the course as these two assignments account for 40% of the course total grade.\n\nWhat is Turnitin?\nYou should be aware that the Reflection Paper will be submitted via Canvas, which is connected to Turnitin. This is an automated system that instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student’s assignment with billions of websites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit assignments through the Canvas Assignment Tool in electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as an instructor, I receive a report from Turnitin that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment."

This means that you are not allowed to go back and review your answers after answering each question.\nCorrect answers will only be shown to students after the deadline of each quiz.\nRefer to Canvas for due dates. Here is a word of advice about weekly quizzes: avoid waiting until the “last minute” to take them. Taking the quizzes earlier will give you enough time to troubleshoot potential technical problems. Quizzes will NOT be reopened after the due dates. Therefore, plan accordingly.\nYou will be given a single attempt on each quiz. This means you need to study the material before taking each quiz. All quizzes are timed. You will have 20 minutes to finish and submit a quiz.\nA quiz will only start if the student has a JavaScript-enabled web-browser. Contact CSUN IT should you run into technical issues when taking quizzes.\nOnce opened, a quiz will appear in a full-screen pop-up window that covers all the other windows and has no navigation control\nIt should be noted that the content of each quiz belongs to McGraw Hill (the publisher of our text).

Keep an open mind when introduced to new ideas that may challenge your perceptions.\nAsk for help when you need it, and assist others when possible.\nUnderstand that communications shared through text have a higher likelihood of being misinterpreted than words that are spoken. Therefore, when you type a thought or a comment, read it carefully before you submit it. If you question the way it is worded, read it out loud to yourself. If you still question the way it’s phrased, rewrite it.\nContribute regularly to group dialogue, including discussion posts and replies. The contributions of each individual plays a role in the collective strength and diversity of our community.\nIf, at any time, you feel that any of these ground rules has been violated by a member of our community, you are encouraged to bring your concern directly and immediately to Dr. Furtado. Clearly identify which ground rule has been violated and include specific evidence of the violation in your e-mail or phone call.
