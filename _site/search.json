A positive correlation occurs when participants who score above the mean on Variable A and Variable B Y, and vice versa (e.g., power clean and vertical jump)​\nNegative correlation: subjects who score below mean on X score above mean on Y, and vice versa (vertical jump and 40-yard dash time) ​\nZ scores: positive if above the mean, negative if below the mean ​\nMagnitude: look at absolute value of r​\nDirection: look at sign of r​"

When correlating one quantitative dependent variable (Yi) with multiple quantitative variables (Xi_1, Xi_2,... Xi_k ).\nit is specially useful when several independent variables work better at predicting a dependent variable compared to a single independent variable. For example, one can estimate percent body fat using the skinfold measurement technique. Although there are several techniques to estimate body site, researchers have used multiple regression techniques to identify the best predictors. See excerpt below:\n\nThe practical equation including age, race, height, weight and waist circumference had high predictive ability for lean body mass (men: R 2=0·91, standard error of estimate (SEE)=2·6 kg; women: R 2=0·85, SEE=2·4 kg) and fat mass (men: R 2=0·90, SEE=2·6 kg; women: R 2=0·93, SEE=2·4 kg). Waist circumference was a strong predictor in men only. Addition of other circumference and skinfold measures slightly improved the prediction model. ref needed"

It’s actually okay if the predictors X and the outcome Y are non-normal, so long as the residuals are normal.\nLinearity. Assumes that the relationship between X and Y is linear (both simple regression or a multiple regression).\nHomogeneity of variance. The regression model assumes that each residual is comes from a normal distribution with mean 0, and with a standard deviation that is the same for every single residual. In practice, it’s impossible to test the assumption that every residual is identically distributed. Instead, what we care about is that the standard deviation of the residual is the same for all values of \\hat{Y}, and all values of every predictor Xi in the model.\nIndependence. The residuals are independent of one another.\n\nAlso, pay attention to the following:\nUncorrelated predictors. In a multiple regression model, you don’t want your predictors to be too strongly correlated with each other. Predictors that are too strongly correlated with each other (referred to as “collinearity”) can cause problems when evaluating the model.\nNo “bad” outliers. There is an implicit assumption that your regression model isn’t being too strongly influenced by one or two anomalous data points. This raises questions about the adequacy of the model and the trustworthiness of the data in some cases."

The intercept is where the line touches the y axis, which in the graph in the left is between 80 and 90. This is the expected value of Yi when Xi is equal to 0.

Each person is in one of several groups and we want to know whether these groups have different mean scores on some outcome variable.\nIn this lessons, I’ll discuss a broader class of experimental designs known as factorial designs, in which we have more than one independent variable (also known as Two-Way ANOVA).\nPreviously we were dealing with one single dependent variable and one single independent variable (2 or 3+ levels). But what if you have more than one IV/grouping variable? Factorial ANOVA is used in instances when there is more than one “factor” of interest; i.e., treatment & sex. The goal is to know the simultaneously effects of several FACTORS on the dependent variable. Thus, from now on, I will refer to it as F-ANOVA."

It’s actually okay if the predictors X and the outcome Y are non-normal, so long as the residuals are normal.\nLinearity. Assumes that the relationship between X and Y is linear (both simple regression or a multiple regression).\nHomogeneity of variance. The regression model assumes that each residual is comes from a normal distribution with mean 0, and with a standard deviation that is the same for every single residual. In practice, it’s impossible to test the assumption that every residual is identically distributed. Instead, what we care about is that the standard deviation of the residual is the same for all values of \\hat{Y}, and all values of every predictor Xi in the model.\nIndependence. The residuals are independent of one another.\n\nAlso, pay attention to the following:\nUncorrelated predictors. In a multiple regression model, you don’t want your predictors to be too strongly correlated with each other. Predictors that are too strongly correlated with each other (referred to as “collinearity”) can cause problems when evaluating the model.\nNo “bad” outliers. There is an implicit assumption that your regression model isn’t being too strongly influenced by one or two anomalous data points. This raises questions about the adequacy of the model and the trustworthiness of the data in some cases."

The idea behind the \\eta^2 is that, when measuring the effect size for a particular term (say, the main effect of Factor A), you want to deliberately ignore the other effects in the model (e.g., the main effect of Factor B).\nThat is, you would pretend that the effect of all these other terms is zero, and then calculate what the \\eta^2-value would have been. This is actually pretty easy to calculate. All you have to do is remove the sum of squares associated with the other terms from the denominator. In other words, if you want the partial η² for the main effect of Factor A, the denominator is just the sum of the SS values for Factor A and the residuals.[1]"

    "text": "Example\n\nData set\nYou can download either the jamovi template or the data set as csv for this example. Then proceed to open the file with jamovi. The data set comes from Weir and Vincent (2021)[2].\n\nIn this design, the researcher wanted to study the effect of 1 day, 3 days, or 5 days of practice per week (20 minutes per day) on the learning of a novel task of nondominant arm throwing accuracy (the dependent variable). In addition, the researcher wanted to know whether subjects with athletic experience (college-level varsity athletes) benefit differently from the various practice conditions than do college students with no experience in athletic competition.[2(p. 181)]\n\nBecause in the example above the researcher wants to test the effect of two independent variables (factors) on a single dependent variable and both factors are between-subjects, we need to use the Between-Between F-ANOVA. This is an example of 3 (practice conditions) x 2 (athletic experience) with equal number of participants in each group (balanced design).\n\nThree subjects in each group were then randomly assigned to one of the three practice conditions (1, 3, or 5 days of practice per week for 20 minutes per day). Number of days of practice was identified as factor B. Subjects’ scores on the throwing task at the end of 6 weeks were recorded as the dependent variable. The scores ranged from 1 to 10 (10 = high).[2(p. 181)]\n\nStep 1: Set up hypotheses and determine the level of significance\nAssume that Factor A refers to Experience and Factor B refers to Practice. Each of the H_0 below will be tested at alpha = 0.05.\nNull hypothesis\nFactor A\nH_0:\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 - There is no difference in the means of factor A\nFactor B\nH_0:\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 - There is no difference in the means of factor B\nInteraction\nH_0: There is no interaction between factors A and B\nAlternative hypothesis\nFactor A\nH_a:\\bar{x}_1 \\neq \\bar{x}_2 - The means are not equal\nFactor B\nH_a:\\bar{x}_1 \\neq \\bar{x}_2 \\neq \\bar{x}_3 - The means are not equal\nInteraction3\nH_a: There is an interaction between factors A and B\nStep 2: Select the appropriate test statistic\nBetween-Between F-ANOVA\n\ncomparing means\ntwo IVs and one DV\nthe IVs are independent groups (between-subjects)\n\nStep 3: Set the decision rule\nFactor A: Reject H_0 is p-value is less than 0.05\nFactor B: Reject H_0 is p-value is less than 0.05\nInteraction: Reject H_0 is p-value is less than 0.05\nStep 4: Compute the test statistic\nSet up\nIn jamovi, choose Analyses > ANOVA > ANOVA. Then, move Throwing Accuracy to the Dependent Variable box. Finally, move Experience and Practice to the Fixed Factors box.\nBecause we have more that one factor, we want to use the partial eta-squared (\\eta^2) as a measure of effect size. Simply check the box Partial \\eta^2 under Effect Size.\n\n\nFigure 1: Between-Between F-ANOVA test set up\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: F-ANOVA table\n\n\n\n\nChecking the assumptions\nBefore we interpret the ANOVA table (see Figure 2), we need to check if all assumptions have been met.\n\nIndependence. In their description of the study, the authors mentioned that participants were randomly assigned to different groups; this assumption has been met.\nOutliers: Create boxplots for each factor. In jamovi, choose Exploration > Descriptive Statistics. Based on the boxplots below, there is no evidence of extreme outliers; thus, we will assume that this assumption has been met.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormality. Upon looking the results of the Shapiro-Wilk test, we conclude that this assumption has been met (p > 0.05). However, others would argue the need to check normality for each combination of the groups of the two independent variables.\nHomogeneity of variance. There needs to be homogeneity of variances for each combination of the groups of the two independent variables. According to the Levene’s test, this assumption has been met (p > 0.05).\n\n\nStep 5: Conclusion - make a decision to whether reject or retain the null hypotheses\n\nMain effect for Experience\nBy looking at the table above, and conclude that there is a Main Effect for factor A (Experience), F(12, 1) = 13.50, p = .003. This indicates that for all three levels of factor B combined, athletes scored significantly better than non-athletes (see Figure 3).\n\n\nFigure 3: Main effect for Experience\n\n\n\nMain effect for Practice\nThere was also a main effect for factor B (Practice), F(12, 2) = 30.29, p < .001. This indicates that for both levels of A combined, a significant difference exists somewhere among the three levels of B. By looking at\n\n\nFigure 4: Main effect for Practice\n\n\n\nInteraction effect\nFinally, there was an interaction effect; F(12, 2) = 4.62, p = .032. This indicates that the effect of practice on throwing accuracy differ in athletes and non-athletes. Figure 5 below suggests that the effect of more days of practice on throwing accuracy is larger in the athletes than in the non-athletes. The significant F for the interaction tells us that the lines in Figure 5 are not statistically parallel.\nAlthough I present the results for both main effects above, arguably, “we must be cautious interpreting the main effects”[2(p. 184)]. This is because the Interaction Effect was significant. In fact, some would suggest[3] to skip the interpretation of the Main Effects if the Interaction effect is significant as it could be misleading.\nUse a step-down process to interpret the results. This means you should evaluate the main effects and interaction, and only proceed to further analysis (post hoc tests) if there is significance.\nA significant interaction tells us that the effects of factor A differs across levels of factor B (and vice-versa).\nThe significant F (F = 4.63, p = .03) for the interaction tells us that the effects of practice on throwing accuracy differ in athletes and nonathletes.\nWe could stop the interaction interpretation right here and simply note that the significant interaction indicates that athletes improve more with more practice than do non-athletes. However, we are often interested is delineating the specific mean differences in the cell means.\nWe can do this performing simple effects tests; see table below.\nSimple effects for A (Experience)\nF across A at B1 > p = .730\nF across A at B2 > p = .008\nF across A at B3 > p = .004\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Interaction effect\n\n\n\nPost Hoc tests\nBecause Practice has more than two levels, we need to perform further analysis by running post hoc tests for the Factor Practice as well as for the Interaction.\nPost hoc tests for Practice\n\nEstimated Marginal Means"
