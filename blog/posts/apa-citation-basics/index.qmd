## Basic principles {#sec-basic-principles}

APA style 7th edition in-text citation refers to the way in which sources are cited within the text of a paper. In-text citations are used to give credit to the sources that were used to support the author's ideas or arguments.

In APA style 7th edition, in-text citations are formatted as follows:

-   For a `direct quote`, include the author's last name, the publication year, and the page number. For example: (Smith, 2020, p. 5)
-   For a `paraphrase` or summary, include the author's last name and the publication year. For example: (Smith, 2020)
-   For 2 authors, include the last names of both authors and the publication year. For example:
    -   According to Smith and Jones (2020), ...

    -   ... (Smith & Jones, 2020)
-   For 3+ authors, include the first authors' last name followed by `et al.` and the publication year. For example: (Smith, et al., 2020)
-   For sources with no author, include the title and the publication year. For example: ("Title of the Article," 2020)
-   For sources with no date, include the author's last name and the date the source was accessed. For example: (Smith, n.d.)

Examples:

-   According to Smith (2020), "the use of technology in education has increased significantly in recent years" (p. 10).
-   The study found that students who use technology in the classroom tend to have better learning outcomes (Smith, 2020).
-   According to Smith and Jones (2020), physical activity helps memory optimization.
-   The research conducted by Smith et al. (2020) suggests that technology can be an effective tool for enhancing student engagement.
-   According to the article "The Impact of Technology on Learning" (2020), the use of technology in education can lead to improved student achievement.
-   The study by Smith (n.d.) found that students who use technology in the classroom tend to have better learning outcomes.

It is important to note that in-text citations should be used in conjunction with a reference list at the end of the paper, where all sources cited in the text are listed in alphabetical order by author's last name. The reference list should include all the information needed to locate the source, such as the author's name, publication date, title, and publication details.

## Parenthetical vs. Narrative citations

| Author type           | Parenthetical citation      | Narrative citation           |
|:----------------------|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| One author            | (Furtado, 2020)             | Furtado (2020)               |
| Two authors           | (Furtado & Gallagher, 2020) | Furtado and Gallagher (2020) |
| Three or more authors | (Furtado et al., 2020)      | Furtado et al. (2020)        |
| Organization          | (Quarto, 2020)              | Quarto (2020)                |

## Secondary sources {#sec-secondary-sources}

In APA style 7th edition, when citing a source that was found within another source, it is known as a "secondary source." The in-text citation for a secondary source includes the author's last name and the year of publication of the original source, in parentheses, followed by the page number (if applicable) where the information was found. Here is an example:

Original source:
Jones, T. (2020). The effects of exercise on mental health. Journal of Psychology, 55(3), 189-202.

Secondary source:
Smith, J. (2021). The benefits of regular exercise. In J. Smith, The complete guide to physical and mental wellness (pp. 45-56). New York: Random House.

In-text citation:

-   According to `Jones (2020)`, regular exercise has positive effects on mental health `(as cited in Smith, 2021, p. 50).`
-   According to `Jones (2020)`, cited in `Smith (2021)`, the rise of obesity has become a growing concern.

Note that in the reference list of your paper, you only need to include the original source, Jones (2020) and not the secondary source, Smith (2021).
