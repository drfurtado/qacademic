This article is meant to help students properly cite sources according the APA Style 7th ed...

## Objectives

After reading this articles, you will be able to:

1.  recognize the different types of in-text citation;
2.  properly cite sources following the APA Style 7th ed.;
3.  ...

## Basic principles

The "APA Style uses the [author--date citation system](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/basic-principles/author-date), in which a brief in-text citation directs readers to a full reference list entry". (ref) Note that you must include each work cited in the reference list.

It's common for APA Style in-text citation to be associated with signal phrases. A signal phrase is a phrase, clause, or even sentence which leads into a quotation or paraphrase. These generally include the speaker/author's name and some justification for using him or her as an expert in this context; it may also help establish the context for the quotation. Below are some examples.

> *According to researchers Furtado and Gallagher, "..."*
>
> *Campos and Mazzardo point out that "..."*

The examples above do not conform (yet) with APA Style 7th ed. To do so, we need to add `year` and `page numbers`.

> *According to researchers Furtado and Gallagher (**2020)**, "..."* **(p. 23).**
>
> *Campos and Mazzardo **(1990)** point out that "..."* **(pp. 22-23).**

Below are some examples of verbs commonly used in signal phrases.

|              |          |            |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Acknowledges | Adds     | Admits     |
| Addresses    | Argues   | Asserts    |
| Believes     | Claims   | Comments   |
| Compares     | Confirms | Contends   |
| Declares     | Denies   | Disputes   |
| Emphasizes   | Endorses | Grants     |
| Illustrates  | Implies  | Insists    |
| Notes        | Observes | Points out |
| Reasons      | Refutes  | Rejects    |
| Reports      | Responds | Suggests   |
| Thinks       | Writes   | Adds       |

Examples of APA Style in-text citation

> Magill and Anderson (2021) argues that motor learning is an important aspect of a child's life.
>
> According to Magill and Anderson (2021), motor learning is an important aspect of a child's life.

In both examples above,Â

-   When authors are not inside the

Author(s) named in the signal phrase - **Direct quote**
