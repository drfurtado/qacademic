### Understanding the problem

When creating `descriptive tables` in jamovi[^2] , you can either select to display variables across columns or across rows. Depending on your choice, tables may not fit your needs.

Below are two examples of descriptive tables generated in `jamovi`. @fig-column shows a table with variables across columns and @fig-row shows a table with variables across rows.

Learn how to choose either format by watching the video at the end of this post.

::: callout-tip
Instead of copying a table from the output, you can export the table as PDF. Some journal articles require authors to save tables as PDF and submit them as separate files.

![Descriptive table with variables across rows](jamov-tab-desc-row.png){#fig-row}
