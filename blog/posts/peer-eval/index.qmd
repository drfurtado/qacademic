As part of their career advancement process, higher education instructors undergo evaluation by their peers.

The `AI Peer-Eval Tool` (AIPET) is designed for evaluators who observe and evaluate their peers' teaching.

This resource is tailored to support faculty in assessing and enhancing their teaching methods through structured peer feedback.

This tool should not be used to replace and completely automatize the process of peer-evaluation. Rather, AIPET should be used to aid evaluators to conduct throughout evaluations and help their peers with constructive feedback.
