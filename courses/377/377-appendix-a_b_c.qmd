## Appendix A

One of the major requirements of this course is to learn how to perform a motor skill (either **Hand Juggling** or **Speed Cup Stacking**). You will be required to practice, learn, **and show proof of mastery for the selected skill by video recording your performance.**

In addition to learning the skill of your preference, you will be required to write a reflection paper discussing your experience.

NOTE: If you have mastered Hand Juggling and Speed Cup Stacking, contact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss alternative skills you may select to practice. Note that you may be asked to prove you have mastered both skills before you are assigned a new skill.

#### The choice of skill

You will be given the option to choose the skill to practice and learn.

You will learn in this course that Juggling and Cup Speed Stacking are placed under two different categories as far as motor learning is concerned. Each skill has different cognitive and motor skill demands. **Juggling** is categorized as a continuous skill. **Continuous skills** have not detectable beginning and end once the performer has started performing it. **Cup Speed Stacking** on the other hand is considered a **discrete skill**, which has a clear beginning and end. One begins by stacking up the first "three" on the left/right and ends by stacking down the opposite "three" (left/right).

**My suggestion:**

-   Watch the demo videos below for both skills;

-   Pick the one that is most appealing to you;

-   Complete the tutorial for the chosen skill (Appendix B);

-   Acquire the proper equipment and start practicing as per the recommendations outlined in this course;

-   When released, complete the update assignments (1, and 2);

-   If after completing the Update 2 assignment you feel the chosen skill is not for you, contact the instructor ASAP to receive permission to switch skills.
