# Definitions

Let's start by defining Motor Learning. Motor Learning is "the study of motor skills, the performance enhancement of learned or highly experienced motor skills, or the reacquisition of skills that are difficult to perform or cannot be performed because of injury, disease, and the like." [@magill2021a, pp. 3-4]
