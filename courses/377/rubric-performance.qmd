1.  Attention Demands: This criterion evaluates the amount of cognitive effort required by the student to perform the motor skill. In the early stages of learning, a significant amount of cognitive activity is needed to understand and execute the skill. As the student progresses, the cognitive demand decreases, allowing them to perform the skill more automatically.

2.  Control of Movement: This criterion assesses the level of conscious and automatic control over the motor skill. In the initial learning stages, students rely heavily on conscious control. As they gain experience, the movement control transitions to be more automatic, allowing smoother execution.

3.  Fluidity & Efficiency: This criterion measures the smoothness, consistency, and efficiency of the student's movements. In the beginning stages, students may struggle with fluidity and efficiency, but their movements become more reliable and efficient as they progress, eventually reaching a superior level.

4.  Precision & Consistency: This criterion assesses the student's ability to perform the motor skill accurately and consistently. Early learners often struggle with precision and consistency. Still, as they progress, they develop the ability to link these elements with their performance, ultimately achieving high accuracy and consistency.

5.  Time: Juggling: you must juggle 3 objects continuously for at least 5 seconds. Cup Stacking: you must complete the "up and down" in under 10 seconds.
