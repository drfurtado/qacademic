1.  Attention Demands: This criterion evaluates the amount of cognitive effort required by the student to perform the motor skill. In the early stages of learning, a significant amount of cognitive activity is needed to understand and execute the skill. As the student progresses, the cognitive demand decreases, allowing them to perform the skill more automatically.

2.  Control of Movement: This criterion assesses the level of conscious and automatic control over the motor skill. In the initial learning stages, students rely heavily on conscious control. As they gain experience, the control of movement transitions to being more automatic, allowing for smoother execution.

3.  Execution Speed: This criterion evaluates the speed at which the student can perform the motor skill. Early in the learning process, students may perform the skill slowly and hesitantly. As they become more proficient, their execution speed increases, ultimately reaching an optimal or exceptional level.

4.  Fluidity & Efficiency: This criterion measures the smoothness, consistency, and efficiency of the student's movements. In the beginning stages, students may struggle with fluidity and efficiency, but as they progress, their movements become more reliable and efficient, eventually reaching a superior level.

5.  Precision & Consistency: This criterion assesses the student's ability to perform the motor skill with accuracy and consistency. Early learners often struggle with precision and consistency, but as they progress, they develop the ability to link these elements with their performance, ultimately achieving a high level of accuracy and consistency.

6.  Tactical Decision Making: This criterion evaluates the student's ability to make effective tactical decisions while performing the motor skill. In the early stages of learning, students may have limited tactical awareness. As they progress, they develop better tactical understanding, which allows them to make advanced and exceptional decisions during performance.
