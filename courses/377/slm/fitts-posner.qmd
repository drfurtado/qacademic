## Introduction:

The Fitts and Posner three-stage model is a widely recognized framework for acquiring motor skills. The model was first proposed by Richard Fitts and Michael Posner in 1967 and has since been used as a foundation for understanding the cognitive and motor processes involved in skill acquisition. The three-stage model provides a clear understanding of how individuals progress from novice to expert in a particular task and is widely applied in fields such as sports psychology, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction.

## The Three Stages of the Model:

### The Cognitive Stage:

The first stage of the model is known as the cognitive stage. In this stage, individuals learn the basic elements of the task and understand the rules and strategies required to perform it. This stage is characterized by focusing on the conscious processing of information and is heavily influenced by cognitive processes such as attention and memory. As a result, individuals are highly reliant on explicit instructions and feedback to guide their performance, and movements often need to be faster and more coordinated.

During the cognitive stage, individuals must understand the task requirements and the strategies for performing it. This requires attention to be directed toward the task, and individuals must process information about the task and its requirements. As a result, their movements are often slow and uncoordinated, reflecting the need for conscious control and attention. Moreover, individuals at this stage rely highly on explicit instructions and feedback to guide their performance, as they have yet to develop a more automatic understanding of the task.

### The Associative Stage:

The second stage of the model is known as the associative stage. During this stage, individuals begin to incorporate implicit learning processes, such as trial and error, into their performance. Movements become smoother and more consistent, and individuals can perform the task with greater accuracy and speed. However, their performance is still not fully automatic, and they may still require conscious thought and effort to perform the task.

At this stage, individuals are beginning to develop a deeper understanding of the task and its requirements. This deeper understanding allows them to use trial and error to improve their performance, as they formance, as they can incorporate implicit learning processes. As a result, movements become smoother and more consistent, and performance improves in terms of accuracy and speed. However, performance is still not fully automatic, and individuals may still require conscious thought and effort to perform the task.

### The Autonomous Stage:

The third and final stage of the model is the autonomous stage. In this stage, individuals have developed a high level of expertise in the task and are able to perform it automatically and effortlessly. The task has become so well-learned that it is no longer necessary to consciously think about how to perform it, and individuals can focus their attention on other aspects of the task. Movement is smooth, accurate, and consistent, and performance is largely unaffected by attentional demands or distractions. At the autonomous stage, individuals have developed a high level of expertise in the task and are able to perform it with ease. The task has become automatic, and individuals no longer need to consciously think about how to perform it. Instead, they are able to perform the task effortlessly, with smooth, accurate, and consistent movements. Performance is largely unaffected by attentional demands or distractions, as the task has become so well-learned that it can be performed automatically.

## Conclusion:

The Fitts and Posner three-stage model is a useful framework for understanding the processes involved in the acquisition of motor skills. It provides a clear understanding of how individuals progress from novice to expert in a particular task and is widely applied in a variety of fields, including sports psychology, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction. By recognizing the different stages of skill acquisition, practitioners in these fields are able to develop more effective training programs and interventions. For example, in sports psychology, understanding the three stages of the model can help coaches to design training programs that are tailored to the needs of athletes at different stages of development. Similarly, in rehabilitation, the model can be used to guide the development of therapy programs that help individuals to regain motor skills after injury or illness. Ultimately, the Fitts and Posner three-stage model continues to be an important tool for understanding the complex process of motor skill acquisition and for improving the development of skills in a variety of contexts.

## Problem Scenarios

### Field of Physical Therapy

A 32-year-old patient named John has recently suffered a stroke and has lost the ability to use his right arm. He has been referred to a physical therapist to help him regain the use of his arm. John's therapist has determined that he is currently at the cognitive stage of the Fitts and Posner three-stage model of motor learning.

The therapist's goal is to help John progress through the stages of the model and ultimately reach the autonomous stage, where he can perform movements with his right arm effortlessly and with a high level of accuracy. However, John is struggling with the cognitive stage, and his movements are slow and uncoordinated. He is heavily reliant on explicit instructions and feedback from his therapist to guide his performance, and he is unable to perform the task without conscious thought and effort.

The therapist recognizes that John needs to progress through the associative stage, where he can incorporate implicit learning processes into his performance, before he can reach the autonomous stage. The therapist needs to develop a therapy program that will help John to move through the associative stage and ultimately reach the autonomous stage. The therapy program should be designed to improve John's accuracy and speed of movement, while also reducing his reliance on explicit instructions and feedback. The program should also be designed to help John to develop a deeper understanding of the task and the requirements for performing it, so that he can incorporate implicit learning processes into his performance.

In order to achieve these goals, the therapist will need to employ a range of techniques and strategies, including repetition, feedback, and the use of visualization and mental rehearsal. The therapist will also need to closely monitor John's progress and adjust the therapy program as needed to ensure that he is able to progress through the stages of the model and ultimately reach the autonomous stage. By successfully navigating the Fitts and Posner three-stage model, John's therapist can help him to regain the use of his arm and achieve a high level of functional independence.

### Field of Physical Education

A physical education teacher named Mrs. Smith has a class of 10-year-old students who are learning gymnastics. The students have a wide range of abilities, with some students being relatively inexperienced and others having prior gymnastics experience. Mrs. Smith has determined that the majority of her students are currently at the cognitive stage of the Fitts and Posner three-stage model of motor learning.

Mrs. Smith's goal is to help her students progress through the stages of the model and ultimately reach the autonomous stage, where they can perform gymnastics movements effortlessly and with a high level of accuracy. However, many of her students are struggling with the cognitive stage and are heavily reliant on explicit instructions and feedback from Mrs. Smith to guide their performance. The students' movements are slow and uncoordinated, and they are unable to perform the movements without conscious thought and effort.

Mrs. Smith recognizes that her students need to progress through the associative stage, where they can incorporate implicit learning processes into their performance, before they can reach the autonomous stage. Mrs. Smith needs to develop a gymnastics program that will help her students to move through the associative stage and ultimately reach the autonomous stage. The gymnastics program should be designed to improve the students' accuracy and speed of movement, while also reducing their reliance on explicit instructions and feedback. The program should also be designed to help the students develop a deeper understanding of the movements and the requirements for performing them, so that they can incorporate implicit learning processes into their performance.

In order to achieve these goals, Mrs. Smith will need to employ a range of techniques and strategies, including repetition, feedback, and the use of visualization and mental rehearsal. Mrs. Smith will also need to closely monitor the students' progress and adjust the gymnastics program as needed to ensure that they are able to progress through the stages of the model and ultimately reach the autonomous stage. By successfully navigating the Fitts and Posner three-stage model, Mrs. Smith can help her students to develop the skills and confidence needed to excel in gymnastics and achieve a high level of functional ability.
