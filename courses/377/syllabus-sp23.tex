\subsection{Course Format}\label{course-format}}

This course consists of readings, written assignments, weekly responses,
and check-ins on our Canvas page.

This is a Fully Online class (OF) in which all class sessions and exams
are presented in an online environment; OF courses have no on-campus
meetings.

For this course, lessons are pre-recorded and students go over the
material on their own pace. However, assignments related to each module
are due at the end of each week during the semester (see course
sequence).

\marginnote{\begin{footnotesize}

Some additional commentary of more peripheral interest.

  If you want to keep access throughout the semester, you need do
  nothing. A charge will be placed on your CSUN student portal account
  (just like tuition, but a separate charge) around the 5th or 6th week
  of classes. You will then be responsible for paying the university.
\item
  If you choose to obtain your materials elsewhere you have until
  \textbf{\texttt{9/25/22}} to Opt-Out (see instructions below). Those
  who Opt-Out by \textbf{\texttt{9/25/22}} will lose access and will
  \textbf{not be charged}.
\item
  Anyone who does not Opt-Out by the \textbf{\texttt{9/25/22}} deadline
  will be charged and those charges \textbf{will not be reversible}.

Although not required, it is suggested that you have access to a
computer (not simply a tablet and/or smartphone) and Internet throughout
this course. Note that CSUN students are eligible to
\href{https://www.csun.edu/it/device-loaner-program}{check out tech
devices from CSUN at NO COST}.

\hypertarget{mini-juggling-balls}{%
\subsubsection{Mini Juggling Balls}\label{mini-juggling-balls}}

One of the requirements of this course is to learn a motor skill. If you
select juggling, I suggest you to acquire the
\href{http://goo.gl/X3EjLE}{mini juggling balls}, which are small and
have the recommended weight for beginners.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-important-color!10!white, colframe=quarto-callout-important-color-frame, opacitybacktitle=0.6, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-important-color}{\faExclamation}\hspace{0.5em}{Important}, opacityback=0, colback=white, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, left=2mm, rightrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, bottomtitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black]
If you choose to use any object other than the mini juggling balls,
understand that your performance may be \textbf{negatively affected} by
it. When performing the exchange technique (required for this activity),
at a given point, performers need to hold two objects in one hand. This
becomes a problem if large objects are being used; i.e., tennis balls.
\end{tcolorbox}

\hypertarget{speed-stacks-sport-stacking-set}{%
\subsubsection{Speed Stacks Sport Stacking
Set}\label{speed-stacks-sport-stacking-set}}

If you choose to learn the cup stacking, I recommend you to acquire the

tournaments}, or grab a set of less expensive ones from Amazon or
elsewhere.

\begin{quote}
DO NOT USE ORDINARY PLASTIC CUPS WHEN PRACTICING AS THEY ARE NOT

In recognition of the fact that grading, however carefully done, will
always be imperfect, this class will utilize a ``round up'' rule for
assigning final grades. I will round up from .5\% and above, but
anything below this will round down. In other words, 79.5 will round up
to 80, while 79.4 will round down to 79 even.

Federal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level
to qualified students with disabilities.

This instructor, in conjunction with California State University
Northridge, is committed to upholding and maintaining all aspects of the
federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. If you are a student with a disability
and wish to request accommodations, please contact the office of
Students with Disabilities Resources located in 110 Student Services
Building, or call (818) 677-2684 for an appointment. Any information
regarding your disability will remain confidential. Because many
accommodations require early planning, requests for accommodations
should be made as early as possible. Any requests for accommodations
will be reviewed in a timely manner to determine their appropriateness
to this setting.

\hypertarget{academic-dishonesty-policy}{%
\subsection{Academic Dishonesty
Policy}\label{academic-dishonesty-policy}}

\emph{Please, \textbf{stop} and read the information below; this is
important!}

Each student is expected to be familiar with, and abide by, the
conditions of student conduct, as presented in the CSUN Catalog, with
emphasis on sections entitled, Student Conduct Code, Academic
Dishonesty, Faculty Policy on Academic Dishonesty, and Penalties. Any
student engaging in academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, fabrication,
facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism) is subject to discipline,
which may include a failing grade in the course, and may also be subject
to more severe discipline by the University. Students are encouraged to
visit the link below and become familiar with the Standards for Student
Conduct.

\hypertarget{reflection-paper-submission}{%
\subsubsection{Reflection Paper
Submission}\label{reflection-paper-submission}}

Plagiarism is a serious violation of the CSUN Student Conduct Code. Be
aware that \textbf{borrowing} a paper from a student who completed this
course previously and writing your paper based on that student's paper
will be considered \textbf{PLAGIARISM}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-important-color!10!white, colframe=quarto-callout-important-color-frame, opacitybacktitle=0.6, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-important-color}{\faExclamation}\hspace{0.5em}{Important}, opacityback=0, colback=white, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, left=2mm, rightrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, bottomtitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black]
Turnitin (see below) will detect such misconducts as it checks every
submission against a database of papers, as well as against the
Internet.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-caution-color!10!white, colframe=quarto-callout-caution-color-frame, opacitybacktitle=0.6, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-caution-color}{\faFire}\hspace{0.5em}{Danger}, opacityback=0, colback=white, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, left=2mm, rightrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, bottomtitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black]
Penalties: If caught, the student will receive a letter grade of ``F''
on BOTH the Reflection Paper and the Video Performance assignments, in
which case the student will likely fail the course as these two
assignments account for 40\% of the course total grade.
\end{tcolorbox}

What is Turnitin?

You should be aware that the Reflection Paper will be submitted via
Canvas, which is connected to
\href{https://www.turnitin.com/}{Turnitin}. This is an automated system
that instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student's
assignment with billions of websites, as well as an enormous database of
student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be
expected to submit assignments through the Canvas Assignment Tool in
electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as an instructor,
I receive a report from \emph{Turnitin} that states if and how another
author's work was used in the assignment.

\hypertarget{course-requirements}{%
\section{Course Requirements}\label{course-requirements}}

To succeed in this course, you will be required to complete several
assignments. To avoid surprises, be proactive and review these
assignments.

\hypertarget{quizzes}{%
\subsection{Quizzes}\label{quizzes}}

Quizzes will be administered via Canvas and will assess the student's
understanding of the topic covered each week. Students are allowed to
utilize class notes and the course text to answer the questions;
however, \textbf{collaboration with other students is not allowed}.

\emph{Here are some other useful information about quizzes:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  When taking quizzes, the questions will appear one at a time and
  locked after being answered. Thus, students are not allowed to go back
  and review answers after saving each question.
\item
  Correct answers will only be shown to students after the deadline of
  each quiz.
\item
  Refer to \texttt{Canvas} and the course sequence for due dates.
  Please, avoid waiting until the ``last minute'' to take the quiz.
  Taking the quizzes earlier will give you enough time to troubleshoot
  potential technical problems; therefore, plan accordingly.
\item
  You will be given a \textbf{single} attempt on each quiz. This means
  you need to study the material before taking each quiz. All quizzes
  are timed. Students will be given 20 minutes to finish and submit a
  quiz.
\item
  A quiz will only start if the student has a JavaScript-enabled
  web-browser. Contact \href{https://www.csun.edu/it}{CSUN IT} should
  you run into technical issues when taking quizzes.
\item
  Once opened, a quiz will appear in a full-screen pop-up window that
  covers all the other windows and has no navigation control
\item
  It should be noted that the content of each quiz belongs to
  \href{https://www.mheducation.com/}{McGraw Hill} (the publisher of our
  text). Therefore, federal copyright laws prohibit the dissemination of
  this material. It includes, but is not limited to, posting the quiz
  online and/or sharing the quiz with someone outside of the classroom.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{online-discussions}{%
\subsection{Online Discussions}\label{online-discussions}}

You will be required to complete several online discussions while taking
this course. The details about each discussion topic will be provided on
Canvas. Typically, there are two deadlines for this assignment. First,
you need to answer the question I post (deadline 1), then respond to
your classmates' posts (deadline 2). Refer to our Class Schedule in
Canvas.

I will post an announcement following the deadline of each discussion
assignment pointing out potential issues.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, opacitybacktitle=0.6, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, opacityback=0, colback=white, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, left=2mm, rightrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, bottomtitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black]
I know how important it is for you to know your current grade in the
class. That is why my priority is to grade most assignments (except for
the paper) within 1 week of the deadline, which will be visible on the
Canvas Gradebook. Note that journal grades will not be visible until all
journals are graded (e.g., original posts and responses).~

If your grades are not posted within a week after the deadline, or you
believe the grade is inaccurate, feel free to email me about the status
of your grade.

\hypertarget{learning-task-performance-reflection-paper}{%
\subsection{Learning Task Performance \& Reflection
Paper}\label{learning-task-performance-reflection-paper}}

\emph{Refer to Canvas for full requirements, but basically:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You will be asked to choose either the 3-object Juggling or Cup Speed
  Stacking activity;
\item
  Then, you will be required to practice and learn the selected
  activity;
\item
  Before the end of the term (see Calendar for deadlines), you will be
  asked to video-record yourself performing the skill you have learned.
  This is the \textbf{Performance} portion of this assignment and
  accounts for 20\% of the final grade;
\item
  The 2nd part of this assignment is a \textbf{Reflection Paper}, which
  also accounts for 20\% of the final grade. As you practice and learn
  the selected skill, you will be advised to use the Motor Learning
  Principles (full details on Canvas) you will be exposed to while
  taking this course.
\item
  Throughout the term, you will be required to update me on your
  progress toward learning the selected skill (juggling or cup
  stacking). See Learning Task Updates below.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{learning-task-updates}{%
\subsection{Learning Task Updates}\label{learning-task-updates}}

You will be submitting several updates throughout the term. These
``updates'' are meant to keep you on track and ensure you are taking
advantages of all the learning techniques covered in this course to
master the selected skill. More information about this assignment will
be provided on Canvas.

\tightlist
\item
  Online classes are deceiving. Many times new online learners expect
  them to be easier than face-to-face classes and are surprised to learn
  how time intensive they are.
\item
  Plan your schedule to ensure you have approximately 10 hours per week
  to spend on this class and take time to identify where and when you'll
  do your learning.
\item
  Review the due dates for the assignments (see Calendar) to orient
  yourself to the flow of the learning. 4. This course requires regular
  engagement throughout each week. Plan to reserve a few hours each day
  to practice the skill you selected for the Learning Task assignment.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{online-etiquette}{%
\subsection{Online Etiquette}\label{online-etiquette}}

All learners in this course will expect to abide by our community ground
rules (see below).

Ground Rules: In an effort to ensure our learning community develops,
thrives and sustains throughout our time together, the following ground
rules will be in effect at all times.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Consider yourself a member of a community. A community is a group of
  individuals who work together to support a common goal or interest. We
  are working together to support the successful achievement of our
  learning outcomes.
\item
  Log-in and participate regularly to group conversations and
  activities.
\item
  Treat the diverse contributions made by other community members with
  respect.
\item
  Have patience and a sense of humor with technology.
\item
  Be a learner. Keep an open mind when introduced to new ideas that may
  challenge your perceptions.
\item
  Ask for help when you need it, and assist others when possible.
\item
  Understand that communications shared through text have a higher
  likelihood of being misinterpreted than words that are spoken.
  Therefore, when you type a thought or a comment, read it carefully
  before you submit it. If you question the way it is worded, read it
  out loud to yourself. If you still question the way it's phrased,
  rewrite it.
\item
  Contribute regularly to group dialogue, including discussion posts and
  replies. The contributions of each individual plays a role in the
  collective strength and diversity of our community.
\item
  If, at any time, you feel that any of these ground rules has been
  violated by a member of our community, you are encouraged to bring
  your concern directly and immediately to Dr.~Furtado. Clearly identify
  which ground rule has been violated and include specific evidence of
  the violation in your e-mail or phone call. Your concerns will be
  addressed promptly and in an individualized manner.

\hypertarget{appendix-a}{%
\subsection{Appendix A}\label{appendix-a}}

One of the major requirements of this course is to learn how to perform
a motor skill (either~\textbf{Hand Juggling}~or~\textbf{Speed Cup
Stacking}). You will be required to practice, learn,~\textbf{and show
proof of mastery for the selected skill by video recording your
performance.}

In addition to learning the skill of your preference, you will be
required to write a reflection paper discussing your experience.

NOTE: If you have mastered Hand Juggling and Speed Cup Stacking, contact
the instructor as soon as possible to discuss alternative skills you may
select to practice. Note that you may be asked to prove you have
mastered both skills before you are assigned a new skill.

\hypertarget{the-choice-of-skill}{%
\paragraph{The choice of skill}\label{the-choice-of-skill}}

You will be given the option to choose the skill to practice and learn.

You will learn in this course that Juggling and Cup Speed Stacking are
placed under two different categories as far as motor learning is
concerned. Each skill has different cognitive and motor skill
demands.~\textbf{Juggling}~is categorized as a continuous
skill.~\textbf{Continuous skills}~have not detectable beginning and end
once the performer has started performing it.~\textbf{Cup Speed
Stacking}~on the other hand is considered a~\textbf{discrete skill},
which has a clear beginning and end. One begins by stacking up the first
``three'' on the left/right and ends by stacking down the opposite
``three'' (left/right).

\textbf{My suggestion:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Watch the demo videos below for both skills;
\item
  Pick the one that is most appealing to you;
\item
  Complete the tutorial for the chosen skill (Appendix B);
\item
  Acquire the proper equipment and start practicing as per the
  recommendations outlined in this course;
\item
  When released, complete the update assignments (1, and 2);
\item
  If after completing the Update 2 assignment you feel the chosen skill
  is not for you, contact the instructor ASAP to receive permission to
  switch skills.
\end{itemize}

It is crucial you study the content of these three appendices.
\textbf{Appendix A} covers the main instructions related to the LEARNING
TASK ASSIGNMENT. In~\textbf{Appendix B}, you find useful tutorials for
both Juggling and Cup Stacking. You will choose one of these two skills
to practice and learn throughout the term (Fall, Spring, Summer, or
Winter).~\textbf{Appendix C}~covers the Motor Learning Principles (MLP)
you will be introduced in this course. The MLP will be crucial when
learning your chosen skill (either juggling or cup stacking).

This the major assignment for this course and accounts fo \textbf{50\%
of the final grade}. Thus, it's crucial you study the content of these
three appendices.
