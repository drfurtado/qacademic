## Course Format

This is a fully online class (OF) in which all class sessions and exams are presented in an online environment; OF courses have no on-campus meetings.

::: callout-warning
This course is not self-paced and is not the "softer, easier way"! This means that you have to **1) check in regularly and 2) respond to the weekly assignments.**
:::

## Required Technology Resources {#sec-required-technology-resources}

This course will be taught completely online (no campus meetings will be required), in an asynchronous format (this course will not have scheduled live meeting times). All activities, assignments and exams in this course will be completed via Canvas. To succeed in this course, you must have reliable access to a computer and internet connection. CSUN offers currently enrolled students the option to borrow devices such as computers and internet `hotspots` through its [Device Loaner Program](https://www.csun.edu/it/device-loaner-program).

## Course Expectations and Goals

At the conclusion of this course, students should be able to:

1.  Describe the difference between motor learning and performance.
2.  Describe and understand different theories of control to explain how motor skills are performed and learned.
3.  Describe and understand the underlying mechanisms and processes involved in the production and control of movement.
4.  Discuss the relationship between attention and performance.
5.  Understand and demonstrate how factors relevant to the individual and to the environment influence the learning process.
6.  Understand and demonstrate how feedback types and schedules influence motor skill learning.
7.  Understand, describe, and demonstrate how practice schedules influence motor skill learning.
8.  Describe how and why the concept of individual differences is important in skill acquisition.
    1.  Describe and understand motor learning and control issues for special populations.
9.  Develop and implement methods of performance assessments.
10. Develop and implement a series of practice sessions designed to teach and/or learn a novel motor skill.

## Student Learning Outcomes (SLO'S)

1.  Apply an integrated kinesiological approach to encourage the adoption of healthy and physically active lifestyles, across diverse populations;
2.  Apply evidence-based practices to enhance the study of human movement;
3.  Demonstrate competent problem-solving strategies through intentional practices; and
4.  Demonstrate knowledge of kinesthetic forms, processes, and structures as they apply to the personal expression and culture of human movement.

## Textbook

## Additional resources

### Access to Computer & Internet

Although not required, it is suggested that you have access to a computer (not simply a tablet and/or smartphone) and Internet throughout this course. Note that CSUN students are eligible to [check out tech devices from CSUN at NO COST](https://www.csun.edu/it/device-loaner-program).

### Mini Juggling Balls

One of the requirements of this course is to learn a motor skill. If you select juggling, I suggest you to acquire the [mini juggling balls](http://goo.gl/X3EjLE), which are small and have the recommended weight for beginners.

::: callout-important
If you choose to use any object other than the mini juggling balls, understand that your performance may be **negatively affected** by it. When performing the exchange technique (required for this activity), at a given point, performers need to hold two objects in one hand. This becomes a problem if large objects are being used; i.e., tennis balls.
:::

### Speed Stacks Sport Stacking Set

If you choose to learn the cup stacking, I recommend you to acquire the [cups used in national and international tournaments](http://goo.gl/Y8HXt5), or grab a set of less expensive ones from Amazon or elsewhere.

> DO NOT USE ORDINARY PLASTIC CUPS WHEN PRACTICING AS THEY ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR CUP STACKING. These cups will significantly affect your performance and your grade, in case you choose cup stacking as your learning task.

# Course Policy

I will detail the policy for this course below. Basically, don't cheat and try to learn stuff.

## Grading Policy

-   **30%**: [Online Quizzes](#sec-quizzes) \[SLO's 1\].

-   **30%**: [Online Discussions] \[SLO's 2\].

-   **15%**: [Learning Task Performance] (final video submission) \[SLO's 1, 2, 4\].

-   **15%**: [Learning Task Reflection] \[SLO's 1, 2, 4\].

-   **10%**: [Learning Task Updates] \[SLO's 1, 2, 4\].

::: callout-note
One quiz and one discussion with the lowest score will be dropped at the end of the term.
:::

## Grading Scale

A 93.00-100.00 \| A- 90.00-92.99 B+ 87.00-89.99 \| B 83.00-86.99 \| B- 80.00-82.99 C+ 77.00-79.99 \| C 73.00-76.99 \| C- 70.00-72.99 D+ 67.00-69.99 \| D 63.00-66.99 \| D- 60.00-62.99 F \<59.99

::: callout-note
In recognition of the fact that grading, however carefully done, will always be imperfect, this class will utilize a "round up" rule for assigning final grades. I will round up from .5% and above, but anything below this will round down. In other words, 79.5 will round up to 80, while 79.4 will round down to 79 even.
:::

::: callout-important
Requests for an Incomplete (I) must conform to [university policies](https://bit.ly/3bDxwZi). Among other requirements, "I" is possible only for instances in which you are demonstrating passing work in the class.
:::

## Attendance Policy

> *Showing up is 80 percent of life* -- Woody Allen, [via Marshall Brickman](http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/06/10/showing-up/#note-6553-1)

Although this is an online course, "attendance" is crucial. And by that, I mean **check-in in Canvas several times a week.**

## E-mail Policy

Email is the official form of communication at California State University, Northridge.  According to campus policy, all students are responsible for reading and understanding messages sent to their campus email accounts. Emails will only be sent to the student's official CSUN email account, NOT a personal email account. CSUN server often filters messages outside the @csun.edu domain. 

If you need clarification on assignments, deadlines, or other course-related matters, please use our Course Mailing List at su23.kin377.01-c\@csun.edu. For all other queries, kindly drop me an email at ovandef\@csun.edu. `Please note that I do not utilize the Canvas Inbox for communication purposes`.

## Office Hours {#sec-office-hours}

#### Online via Zoom

Please, provide your availability by visiting this link: [https://bit.ly/furtado-bkme](#0)

## Make-Up Exam Policy

Unless the student has discussed the situation with the instructor before the assignment's due date and an arrangement has been made, a missed assignment will result in a grade of zero. **Note that making "arrangements" will only be possible given the student provides a valid and written excuse from a reputable source**.

## Late Assignments

In case you haven't made any prior arrangements, submitting a late assignment will result in a 5% deduction per day for the first four days it is overdue. After the fourth day, all assignments will be considered closed.

## Extra Credit

With the exception of the extra 10 points awarded to the final video performance (either juggling or cup stacking), there is no individual extra credit granted.

## Disabilities Policy {#sec-disabilities-policy}

Federal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level to qualified students with disabilities.

This instructor, in conjunction with California State University Northridge, is committed to upholding and maintaining all aspects of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. If you are a student with a disability and wish to request accommodations, please contact the office of Students with Disabilities Resources located in 110 Student Services Building, or call (818) 677-2684 for an appointment. Any information regarding your disability will remain confidential. Because many accommodations require early planning, requests for accommodations should be made as early as possible. Any requests for accommodations will be reviewed in a timely manner to determine their appropriateness to this setting.

## Academic Dishonesty Policy

*Please, **stop** and read the information below; this is important!*

Each student is expected to be familiar with, and abide by, the conditions of student conduct, as presented in the CSUN Catalog, with emphasis on sections entitled, Student Conduct Code, Academic Dishonesty, Faculty Policy on Academic Dishonesty, and Penalties. Any student engaging in academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism) is subject to discipline, which may include a failing grade in the course, and may also be subject to more severe discipline by the University. Students are encouraged to visit the link below and become familiar with the Standards for Student Conduct.

<http://www.csun.edu/a&r/soc/studentconduct.html>

### Reflection Paper Submission

Plagiarism is a serious violation of the CSUN Student Conduct Code. Be aware that **borrowing** a paper from a student who completed this course previously and writing your paper based on that student's paper will be considered **PLAGIARISM**.

::: callout-important
Turnitin (see below) will detect such misconducts as it checks every submission against a database of papers, as well as against the Internet.
:::

::: callout-caution
Penalties: If caught, the student will receive a letter grade of "F" on BOTH the Reflection Paper and the Video Performance assignments, in which case the student will likely fail the course as these two assignments account for 40% of the course total grade.
:::

What is Turnitin?

You should be aware that the Reflection Paper will be submitted via Canvas, which is connected to [Turnitin](https://www.turnitin.com/). This is an automated system that instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student's assignment with billions of websites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit assignments through the Canvas Assignment Tool in electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as an instructor, I receive a report from *Turnitin* that states if and how another author's work was used in the assignment.

# Course Requirements

To succeed in this course, you will be required to complete several assignments. To avoid surprises, be proactive and review these assignments.

## Online Quizzes {#sec-quizzes}

Quizzes will be administered via Canvas and will assess the student's understanding of the topic covered each week. Students are allowed to utilize class notes and the course text to answer the questions; however, **collaboration with other students is not allowed**.

*Here are some other useful information about quizzes:*

1.  Quizzes are posted on Monday and remain open until Sunday at 11:59 pm. Once started, students have 20 minutes to complete and submit the each quiz.

2.  When taking quizzes, the questions will appear one at a time and locked after being answered. Thus, students are not allowed to go back and review answers after saving each question.

3.  Correct answers will only be shown to students after the deadline of each quiz.

4.  Refer to `Canvas` and the course sequence for due dates. Please, avoid waiting until the "last minute" to take the quiz. Taking the quizzes earlier will give you enough time to troubleshoot potential technical problems; therefore, plan accordingly.

5.  You will be given a **single** attempt on each quiz. This means you need to study the material before taking each quiz. All quizzes are timed. Students will be given 20 minutes to finish and submit a quiz.

6.  A quiz will only start if the student has a JavaScript-enabled web-browser. Contact [CSUN IT](https://www.csun.edu/it) should you run into technical issues when taking quizzes.

7.  Once opened, a quiz will appear in a full-screen pop-up window that covers all the other windows and has no navigation control

8.  It should be noted that the content of each quiz belongs to [McGraw Hill](https://www.mheducation.com/) (the publisher of our text). Therefore, federal copyright laws prohibit the dissemination of this material. It includes, but is not limited to, posting the quiz online and/or sharing the quiz with someone outside of the classroom.

## Online Discussions

You will be required to complete several online discussions while taking this course. The details about each discussion topic will be provided on Canvas. Typically, there are two deadlines for this assignment. First, you need to answer the question I post (deadline 1), then respond to your classmates' posts (deadline 2). Refer to our Class Schedule in Canvas. The first deadline[^1] is typically on Thursday and the second (final) is on Sunday.

[^1]: Note that the first deadline does not show in Canvas, only the second deadline on Sunday. Deadline 1 is in place because I want other students to read and comment on everyone's posts.

::: callout-note
I know how important it is for you to know your current grade in the class. That is why my priority is to grade most assignments (except for the paper) within 1 week of the deadline, which will be visible on the Canvas Gradebook.

If your grades are not posted within a week after the deadline, or you believe the grade is inaccurate, feel free to email me about the status of your grade.
:::

## Learning Task Performance

*Refer to Canvas for full requirements, but basically:*

-   You will be asked to choose either the 3-object Juggling or Cup Speed Stacking activity;
-   Then, you will be required to practice and learn the selected activity;
-   Before the end of the term (see [Course Sequence]), you will be asked to video-record yourself performing the skill you have learned. This is the **Performance** portion of this assignment and accounts for 15% of the final grade;

## Learning Task Reflection

-   The 2nd part of this assignment is a **Reflection Paper**, which also accounts for 20% of the final grade. As you practice and learn the selected skill, you will be advised to use the Motor Learning Principles (full details on Canvas) you will be exposed to while taking this course.
-   Throughout the term, you will be required to update me on your progress toward learning the selected skill (juggling or cup stacking). See Learning Task Updates below.

## Learning Task Updates

You will be submitting several updates throughout the term. These "updates" are meant to keep you on track and ensure you are taking advantages of all the learning techniques covered in this course to master the selected skill. More information about this assignment will be provided on Canvas.

# Final (yet important) Notes {#sec-important-notes}

## How to Access our Course and Get Started

-   Log into Canvas: <https://canvas.csun.edu>
-   Under "My Courses," locate our course and click on it.
-   This will take you to the course home page.

## Technology Requirements and Support:

-   A computer and access to the internet (reliable connection)
-   Google Chrome (web browser)
-   A device to record video (phone, tablet, or laptop)

## What I Expect of You:

1.  Online classes are deceiving. Many times new online learners expect them to be easier than face-to-face classes and are surprised to learn how time intensive they are.
2.  Plan your schedule to ensure you have approximately 10 hours per week to spend on this class and take time to identify where and when you'll do your learning.
3.  Review the due dates for the assignments (see Calendar) to orient yourself to the flow of the learning. 4. This course requires regular engagement throughout each week. Plan to reserve a few hours each day to practice the skill you selected for the Learning Task assignment.

## Online Etiquette

All learners in this course will expect to abide by our community ground rules (see below).

Ground Rules: In an effort to ensure our learning community develops, thrives and sustains throughout our time together, the following ground rules will be in effect at all times.

1.  Consider yourself a member of a community. A community is a group of individuals who work together to support a common goal or interest. We are working together to support the successful achievement of our learning outcomes.
2.  Log-in and participate regularly to group conversations and activities.
3.  Treat the diverse contributions made by other community members with respect.
4.  Have patience and a sense of humor with technology.
5.  Be a learner. Keep an open mind when introduced to new ideas that may challenge your perceptions.
6.  Ask for help when you need it, and assist others when possible.
7.  Understand that communications shared through text have a higher likelihood of being misinterpreted than words that are spoken. Therefore, when you type a thought or a comment, read it carefully before you submit it. If you question the way it is worded, read it out loud to yourself. If you still question the way it's phrased, rewrite it.
8.  Contribute regularly to group dialogue, including discussion posts and replies. The contributions of each individual plays a role in the collective strength and diversity of our community.
9.  If, at any time, you feel that any of these ground rules has been violated by a member of our community, you are encouraged to bring your concern directly and immediately to Dr. Furtado. Clearly identify which ground rule has been violated and include specific evidence of the violation in your e-mail or phone call. Your concerns will be addressed promptly and in an individualized manner.
