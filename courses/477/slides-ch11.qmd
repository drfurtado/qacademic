You will be:

3.  given 2 min to study the concept...then, or
4.  picked to share your decision

. . .

Either case, you need to elaborate a bit...

## Examples

. . .

**Example1:**

The planet Earth is flat.

. . .

**Example2:**

A pentagon has 5 sides.

## Concept 1

Strength increases as muscle grows - increases and decreases in strength do not always parallel muscle size.

::: notes
T - Why no paralell - neuromuscular coordination and endocrine changes also affect strength‚ increases and decreases in strength do not always parallel muscle size.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
Strength increases as muscle grows; however, since neuromuscular coordination and endocrine changes also affect strength‚ increases and decreases in strength do not always parallel muscle size.
:::

## Concept 2

Young boys (prepubescent) and girls are different in strength, but it gets more similar after puberty.

::: notes
F - Young boys and girls are **similar** in strength, but notable **differences** appear after puberty‚

Where? mostly in arm and shoulder strength. 
:::

## Concept 3 {.scrollable}

Prepubescent children can increase `strength` through training without an increase in muscle size‚ but after puberty everyone can increase `strength` and muscle mass through training.

::: notes
T - Why?

As noted previously, strength is related both to muscle size and to the central nervous system's ability to fully activate muscles. Improvement in prepubescents with training likely results from their improved ability to exert force in the intended direction as they are better able to activate the agonist (contracting) muscles and coordinate the antagonist (lengthening) muscles (Sale, 1989).

## Concept 4

As compared with their peers, the strongest children do not always turn out to be the strongest adolescents.

::: notes
T - As compared with their peers, the strongest children do not always turn out to be the strongest adolescents, **since maturation rate can influence relative strength among children.**

## Concept 5

Among same-size children of different ages, less mature children are stronger.​

. . .

::: notes
F - Among same-size children of different ages, **more** mature children are stronger.​

Why

-   **endocrine function that probably influences strength**

-   **neural factors that likely exert influence (including improved motor unit activation with maturation).**​

## Concept 6

Notable declines in strength occur after age 50 at a greater rate than expected, but changes vary between individuals.

. . .

::: notes
T - Notable declines in strength occur after age 50 at a greater rate than expected **from loss of muscle mass**‚ but changes vary between individuals **and are related to the extent of habitual physical activity.**

# Constraints and Strength Development

# Older adults

Consider the older adults in your society. Can you think of constraints (individual, environmental, and task) that might lead to a loss of strength in the older years? 

You will be

1.  given access to the whiteboard
    1.  use the `Text` option and type an individual, environmental, and a task constraint

::: notes
**Individual:** A functional constraint might be motivation. An individual who is not motivated to do active things or to exercise would lose strength in middle and older adulthood. A structural constraint might be a disease that makes it difficult for someone to exercise. 

**Environmental:** An individual who does not have an environment conducive to exercise could lose strength. For example, someone who lives in a harsh, far north climate might find it difficult to exercise in the winter. 

**Task:** Activities that do not provide much resistance training, although they might provide maintenance of some strength, still might lead overall to a loss of strength. 
:::

# Strength training implications {.scrollable}

`Question 1`: Even if prepubescent children can improve their strength with training, does such training involve negative effects?

::: notes
Children's bones are still growing and could be susceptible to injury at both traction and pressure epiphyses. Weight training could potentially cause a single traumatic injury or chronic injury from repeated lifts.
:::

:::

. . .

`Question 2`: What are the differences, if any, between the results achieved by adult men and adult women who train for strength?​

::: notes
As a result of differential growth of muscle mass **during adolescence** the average adult man is stronger than the average adult woman. Women can produce only 60% to 80% of the force that men can exert, although most of these differences can be attributed to differences in arm and shoulder strength rather than in trunk or leg strength (Asmussen, 1973)

## Summary - Strength Development

-   Childhood is a period of steady increase in strength
-   Adolescent girls continue a steady increase
-   Adolescent boys experience a spurt of growth in strength
-   Strength levels are stable in young adulthood
-   Strength declines in older adulthood, gradually at first
-   Training can improve strength throughout the life span
-   Strength is related to muscle mass and neurologicalfactors

## Before we go...

::: callout-warning
Adolescents, like children, should be closely supervised when using weight training to improve strength. Their bones are still growing, and they are susceptible to a variety of musculoskeletal injuries if unsupervised (Risser & Preston, 1989, cited in @haywood2019).

## Concept 1

Each joint has its own range of flexibility, and flexibility tends to decline in adolescence and adulthood because of decreases in joint laxity, decreases in body mass, and lack of activity and exercise.

down- increases in body mass
