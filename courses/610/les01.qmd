## Course intro

In Lesson 1 you will be introduced to this course. Please, read and study the [syllabus](syllabus.qmd) prior to coming to the [first meeting](sequence.qmd).

## Data collection

As part of Lesson 1, you will be asked to complete several cognitive tests. The data collected from these tests will be used when I cover data analyzes later in the semester.

### Tests

Below you will find links to several tests you will be required to take. Wait for more instructions from the instructor before taking the test. Please, do not take the tests prior to attending the first meeting as it with the internal validity[^1] of each test.

[^1]: Refers to the lack of reliability when collecting data. If some participants are familiar with the test, this can be a threat to the internal validity of the study.

#### Memory test
