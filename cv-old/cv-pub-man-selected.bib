  abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) has become an effective alternative to promote exercise. However, limited studies have investigated the effect of VR on pain and fatigue in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of using VR during exercise on pain and fatigue in individuals with SCI. This study employed a concurrent nested mixed-methods design. Materials and Methods: Eleven individuals with SCI completed a 6-minute exercise test using arm ergometry with and without VR. Pain and fatigue questionnaire data were collected using Pain Self Efficacy Questionnaire, the Fatigue Severity Scale, and the Fatigue Assessment Scale. Qualitative data were collected after the VR session. Results: Participants experienced less pain and fatigue during VR exercise than during non-VR exercise. Qualitative data were consistent with the questionnaire results. Conclusion: Clinicians should consider the use of VR in reducing pain and fatigue.},

  abstract = {Previous research has shown that older athletes within age groupings are often perceived to be more talented simply due to advanced maturity, leading to biased selection in higher levels of sports competition, now commonly termed relative age effect (RAE). This study’s goals were to determine whether (a) RAE influenced the selection of junior college baseball participants and (b) academic timing (Glamser \& Marciani, 1992), in which academic status determines age groupings more than strict age guidelines for college sports, influenced the formation of RAE. Participants were 150 junior college baseball players. Our results showed that RAE was only a significant factor, comparing the birth distribution of participants born before and after the midpoint of the participation year, when academic timing was also a factor in determining age groupings. In addition, the birth rate distribution, though not significantly different than expected, was greater only when those participants born during the expected participation year were included. The results of this study indicate that RAE could bear more influence among American student-athletes than was previously reported in that RAE in conjunction with academic timing does influence the selection of collegiate athletes.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the decision-making performance of experienced and inexperienced soccer players at four exercise intensities (rest, 40\%, 60\%, and 80\% maximal aerobic power). The decision-making performance of inexperienced players was expected to demonstrate an inverted-U shape with increasing levels of exercise. For the experienced players, decision making was predicted to show no change in performance with increased exercise intensity. Thirty-two adult soccer players (16 experienced, 16 inexperienced) were asked to answer seven decision-making questions as quickly and accurately as possible for each exercise intensity. Results indicated that exercise does not affect the accuracy of decision making; however, the speed of decision making for experienced and inexperienced players improved with increased exercise intensity. These results suggest that physiologically induced arousal only affects speed of decision making.},

Magill recommended basing decisions on Naylor and Briggs' hypothesis of task complexity and organization, while Schmidt and Wrisberg recommended basing decisions on skill classification. To evaluate the accuracy of these recommendations, a meta-analysis was conducted. Through a literature search, 44 articles were located, and 20 provided sufficient information to calculate effect sizes. Effect sizes were calculated using means for whole and part practice for acquisition and retention. Although several analyses were compromised by insufficient studies investigating whole and part practice, mean effect sizes generally supported motor learning textbooks. To better verify the empirical validity of recommendations for the use of whole and part practice, more studies are necessary.},

  abstract = {Obesity has reached epidemic levels, and physical education teachers are on the front lines to combat it. However, anti-fat bias from physical education teachers may be a barrier against the participation of students who are obese in physical activity. Thus, our purpose was to investigate the attitude of physical education teachers and majors toward obese individuals. Forty-seven physical education teachers and 149 majors participated in the study. Participants answered three questionnaires: Anti-Fat Attitude Scale (AFAS measures explicit attitudes toward obese individuals), Perception of Obese Students by Physical Education Teachers questionnaire (POSPET measures how teachers perceive students who are obese during class), and Implicit Association Test (IAT is a timed assessment measuring automatic attitudes toward obese individuals through word categorizations: good–bad, lazy–motivated). Based on one sample t tests, AFAS results indicated a neutral attitude by teachers (t46 = -1.63, p = .11) and majors (t148 = .80, p = .43) toward obese individuals, and POSPET results indicated teachers have a pro-fat bias toward obese students (t42 = -8.99, p {$<$} .01). However, when answers were automatically evoked, good–bad and lazy–motivated IAT scores indicated a strong anti-fat bias by teachers (t37 = 12.31, p {$<$} .01 and t35 = 13.12, p {$<$} .01, respectively) and majors (t137 = 16.96, p {$<$} .01 and t134 = 20.77, p {$<$} .01, respectively). Using independent t tests, significant differences between teachers and majors were not found for good–bad (t174 = .34, p = .74) and lazy–motivated IAT (t169 = -1.05, p = .21). IAT scores showed a strong and similar anti-fat bias among physical education teachers and majors. Anti-fat bias should be an important part of PETE and continuing education programs because it could play a role in the prevention of obesity.},

  abstract = {Anti-fat bias by professors in physical education departments may interfere with the training provided to pre-service teachers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the attitudes of professors in physical education departments toward obese individuals. Professors from randomly selected institutions across all four US regions participated in the study (N = 94). Participants took the Implicit Association Test and answered the Anti-Fat Attitude Scale and two questions specifically designed to measure their attitudes toward physical education teachers and majors who are obese. The participants exhibited implicit good–bad (p {$<$} .001) and lazy–motivated (p {$<$} .001) anti-fat biases. Professors favored accepting majors who are obese (p {$<$} .001), but they strongly disapproved of obese physical education teachers as role models to their students (p {$<$} .001). Explicit anti-fat bias was associated with a stronger disapproval of physical education teachers who are obese as role models to students (p {$<$} .001) and accepting majors who are obese (p {$<$} .001). Implicit good–bad anti-fat bias was associated with a stronger disapproval of obese physical education teachers as role models to students (p = .047). The anti-fat bias demonstrated by the professors may negatively affect the training of pre-service physical education teachers to work with students of all body sizes. Awareness programs may be necessary to diminish anti-fat bias among professors in physical education teacher education programs.},

  abstract = {Attention is very important for learning. Children are known for not paying much attention due to lack of selective attention resources. Selective attention is the ability to direct the attentional focus to a specific point in the environment, in order to pay attention to what is relevant (Ladewig et all, 2001). One way to assist children to pay more attention while teaching a task, is by using cues, that are one or two words, short phrases, with higher meaning to the learner. The objective of the current study was to test the efficacy of the cues, while school children performed the backhand. The statistical results of the retention test have shown, after 20 days rest without any practice, very high levels of significance in favor of the cue group, which was even able to increase the mean average from the post-test. On the other hand, children that did not receive cues had a decrease in performance in all six technical factors, from the post-test to the retention. In conclusion, the use of learning cues was very effective in assisting children to learn the backhand. Future research must continue to explore the use of cues, while teaching different motor skills in different contexts.},
