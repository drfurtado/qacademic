Methods—controlled studies, user surveys, interviews, co-design workshops, web scraping, behaviour logging.\nI am passionate about open and transparent research. Since 2018, I have shared materials, analysis scripts, and data for all my first-authored work, and written my papers as reproducible documents in R Markdown."

    "text": "Basic principles\nAPA style 7th edition in-text citation refers to the way in which sources are cited within the text of a paper. In-text citations are used to give credit to the sources that were used to support the author’s ideas or arguments.\nIn APA style 7th edition, in-text citations are formatted as follows:\n\nFor a direct quote, include the author’s last name, the publication year, and the page number. For example: (Smith, 2020, p. 5)\nFor a paraphrase or summary, include the author’s last name and the publication year. For example: (Smith, 2020)\nFor 2 authors, include the last names of both authors and the publication year. For example:\n\nAccording to Smith and Jones (2020), …\n… (Smith & Jones, 2020)\n\nFor 3+ authors, include the first authors’ last name followed by et al. and the publication year. For example: (Smith, et al., 2020)\nFor sources with no author, include the title and the publication year. For example: (“Title of the Article,” 2020)\nFor sources with no date, include the author’s last name and the date the source was accessed. For example: (Smith, n.d.)\n\nExamples:\n\nAccording to Smith (2020), “the use of technology in education has increased significantly in recent years” (p. 10).\nThe study found that students who use technology in the classroom tend to have better learning outcomes (Smith, 2020).\nAccording to Smith and Jones (2020), physical activity helps memory optimization.\nThe research conducted by Smith et al. (2020) suggests that technology can be an effective tool for enhancing student engagement.\nAccording to the article “The Impact of Technology on Learning” (2020), the use of technology in education can lead to improved student achievement.\nThe study by Smith (n.d.) found that students who use technology in the classroom tend to have better learning outcomes.\n\nIt is important to note that in-text citations should be used in conjunction with a reference list at the end of the paper, where all sources cited in the text are listed in alphabetical order by author’s last name. The reference list should include all the information needed to locate the source, such as the author’s name, publication date, title, and publication details."

    "text": "Parenthetical vs. Narrative citations\nIn APA style, there are two main types of in-text citations: parenthetical and narrative.\nParenthetical citations are brief citations that are included within parentheses in the text of the paper. They include the author’s last name and the publication year. For example: (Smith, 2020).\nNarrative citations are integrated into the text of the paper, rather than being enclosed in parentheses. They include the author’s last name and the publication year. For example, according to Smith (2020), ….\nThe main difference between the two is how they are presented within the text, with Parenthetical citations appearing within the parentheses and Narrative citations being integrated into the text. Both types of citation provide the necessary information for the reader to locate the source in the reference list. It is important to note that Parenthetical citations are preferred in APA style, but the narrative citations are also acceptable as long as they are clear and consistent throughout the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor type\nParenthetical citation\nNarrative citation\n\n\n\n\nOne author\n(Furtado, 2020)\nFurtado (2020)\n\n\nTwo authors\n(Furtado & Gallagher, 2020)\nFurtado and Gallagher (2020)\n\n\nThree or more authors\n(Furtado et al., 2020)\nFurtado et al. (2020)\n\n\nOrganization\n(Quarto, 2020)\nQuarto (2020)"

Here is an example:\nOriginal source: Jones, T. (2020). The effects of exercise on mental health. Journal of Psychology, 55(3), 189-202.\nSecondary source: Smith, J. (2021). The benefits of regular exercise. In J. Smith, The complete guide to physical and mental wellness (pp. 45-56). New York: Random House.\nIn-text citation:\n\nAccording to Jones (2020), regular exercise has positive effects on mental health (as cited in Smith, 2021, p. 50).\nAccording to Jones (2020), cited in Smith (2021), the rise of obesity has become a growing concern.\n\nNote that in the reference list of your paper, you only need to include the original source, Jones (2020) and not the secondary source, Smith (2021)."
