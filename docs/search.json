    "text": "P-value is a statistical measure that is widely used in the field of bioestatistics. It is a probability that represents the likelihood of obtaining a result that is at least as extreme as the one observed, if the null hypothesis (the hypothesis that there is no relationship between the variables being studied) is true.\nIn other words, the p-value helps researchers determine whether the results of their study are statistically significant or not. A p-value of less than 0.05 is generally considered to be statistically significant, meaning that there is a less than 5% chance that the observed results occurred by chance. On the other hand, a p-value of greater than 0.05 suggests that the observed results could have occurred by chance and are not statistically significant.\nHowever, it is important to note that the p-value is not a direct measure of the size or strength of the relationship between the variables being studied. It only provides information about the statistical significance of the results. Therefore, it is important to interpret the p-value in the context of the study and to consider other factors, such as the sample size, the magnitude of the effect, and the relevance of the results to the research question.\nIn addition, it is important to note that the p-value should not be used as the sole criterion for determining whether a result is statistically significant or not. Other statistical measures, such as confidence intervals and effect sizes, can provide additional information about the strength and magnitude of the relationship between the variables being studied.\nOverall, the p-value is a valuable tool for assessing the statistical significance of research results in the field of bioestatistics. It helps researchers determine whether their results are likely to be true or simply due to chance, and it is an important factor to consider when interpreting and communicating the results of a study."

    "text": "An example using R\nA researcher wanted to investigate if boys and girls differ on body mass index (BMI). She collected data on five boys (2) and five girls (1).\n\n\n   bmi sex\n1   32   1\n2   33   1\n3   34   1\n4   32   1\n5   30   1\n6   29   2\n7   30   2\n8   33   2\n9   27   2\n10  28   2\n\n\nPrior to running the Student’s t-test for independent means, I will check for the assumption of equal variances between the two groups.\nThis can be done with the var.test() function in R. With the variance test, we want the p-value to be above 0.05, which would indicate that the variance between the two groups is not statistically significant.\nIf the var.test() were found to be statistically significant, the Welch’s Two Sample t-test must be used in place of the Independent-Samples t-test.\n\nvar.test(bmi ~ sex)\n\n\n    F test to compare two variances\n\ndata:  bmi by sex\nF = 0.41509, num df = 4, denom df = 4, p-value = 0.4153\nalternative hypothesis: true ratio of variances is not equal to 1\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.0432186 3.9867860\nsample estimates:\nratio of variances \n         0.4150943 \n\n\nSince the calculated p-value is above 0.05 (0.4153), there is no evidence the variance between the two groups is different. We can now proceed to with the t-test.\n\nt.test(bmi ~ sex, var.equal=TRUE)\n\n\n    Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  bmi by sex\nt = 2.2862, df = 8, p-value = 0.05157\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 1 and group 2 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.02426674  5.62426674\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 1 mean in group 2 \n           32.2            29.4 \n\n\nTo conclude, the Student’s Independent-Samples t-test was used to compare the BMI mean values between boys (M = 32.2) and girls (M = 29.4). No significant difference was found between the groups, t(8) = 2.2862, p-value < 0.05."
