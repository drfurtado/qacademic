    "section": "Structure & Requirements",
    "text": "Structure & Requirements\nYou are responsible for the material covered in the textbook prior to attending each class. Note that the week’s readings are specified in the course sequence.\nIn addition to these readings, the instructor may assign supplemental readings throughout the semester. These supplemental readings do not appear on the schedule as these readings will be assigned at the instructor’s discretion.\nThe assignments used to enhance your learning experience in this course include:\n\nPreparedness\nYou will be evaluated on your preparedness by submitting an assignment before each class (Major Takeaways).\n\n\nParticipation & Attendance\nClass presence and participation points are given to encourage your active class participation and discussion. You will be rewarded with a perfect score as long as you frequently come to class and actively contribute to the class discussion during lectures.\nAlthough it is not required, most students send their professor a brief e-mail to explain their absence in advance.\n\n\nQuizzes\nBefore each class, you will complete a multiple-choice quiz on the topic covered for that week. You will be given multiples attempts and the highest grade will be used.\n\n\nHomeworks\nStudents will complete three (3) homework assignments on this course. The purpose of each assignment is to assist students in applying their understanding of the statistical procedures discussed in class as well as to provide an opportunity for students to respond to the readings.\nHomework assignments have two components. The first part is performing the statistical calculations correctly using jamovi. The second component involves interpreting the statistical analyses. When answering the interpretation questions, the point is to show that you know what your numbers mean, so don’t simply provide the definition of the term. For instance, if you calculate the “number needed to treat (NNT)” as NNT = 7.69, the interpretation of this number is something like “7.69 people must be given the treatment to prevent one adverse event. The wrong answer is something like”the NNT tells you how many people must be given the treatment to prevent one adverse event.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou are allowed to discuss homework with other students (and with the instructor), but you must write final answers yourself, in your own words. Solutions prepared “in committee” or by copying or paraphrasing someone else’s work are not acceptable; your hand-in assignments must represent your own thoughts (refer to [Academic Dishonesty Policy](#dishonesty) for more information); especially, the information about PLAGIARISM.\n\n\n\n\nExams\nYou will be required to complete two (2) exams in this course. Students may use their notes and textbook for the exams, but no other outside resource other than a calculator can be used.\nEach exam have 10 questions, with each question worth 10 points. Exams must be completed in the allotted time. The focus of the exams (and quizzes) will be on concepts and interpretation, with most of the computational activities occurring in the homework assignments.\nAlthough the quizzes and exams will not focus on previously tested material (they are not meant to be cumulative), knowledge of previously tested material may be inherently required to answer questions related to new material.\nMost of the computational activities will be via the homework assignments. In addition, selected readings will be assigned through the semester. The content of these readings will be included on exam and quiz questions and in homework assignments."

Basically, don’t cheat and try to learn stuff.\n\nGrading\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nMajor Takeaways (14)*\n15%\n\n\nParticipation & Attendance\n5%\n\n\nWeekly Quizzes (14)*\n20%\n\n\nHomeworks (3)\n30%\n\n\nExams (2)\n30%\n\n\n\n*The lowest score will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nGrading Scale\nA 93.00-100.00 | A- 90.00-92.99 B+ 87.00-89.99 | B 83.00-86.99 | B- 80.00-82.99 C+ 77.00-79.99 | C 73.00-76.99 | C- 70.00-72.99 D+ 67.00-69.99 | D 63.00-66.99 | D- 60.00-62.99 F <59.99\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn recognition of the fact that grading, however carefully done, will always be imperfect, this class will utilize a “round up” rule for assigning final grades. I will round up from .5% and above, but anything below this will round down. In other words, 79.5 will round up to 80, while 79.4 will round down to 79 even.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRequests for an Incomplete (I) must conform to university policies. Among other requirements, “I” is possible only for instances in which you are demonstrating passing work in the class.\n\n\n\n\nAttendance\n\nShowing up is 80 percent of life – Woody Allen, via Marshall Brickman\n\nAttendance will be taken at the beginning of every class; please, plan accordingly.\n\n\nE-mail\nWhile taking this course, only communicate with me via Canvas > Inbox.\nIf your message concerns a non-private matter (i.e., assignments, content, deadlines, etc.), then please post your question to the Q&A Forum (Canvas > Discussions > Q&A Forum), which can be answered by any student taking the course.\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\nIn-person\nTuesdays from 9-11 am at RE 289.\n\n\nOnline via Zoom\nBy appointment only via https://calendly.com/drfurtado\n\n\n\nLate Assignments\nUnless you have made previous arrangements, a late assignments will be docked 10% per day (first 4 days) it is late. Students will not be allowed to submit assignments after the fourth day of the deadline.\n\n\nExtra Credit\nThere is no individual extra credit granted. Therefore, do not plan to make-up poor grades at the end of the semester by asking to do extra credit work. I might provide extra credit opportunities, but these will be offered to the entire class, not to individuals.\n\n\nDisabilities\nFederal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level to qualified students with disabilities.\nThis instructor, in conjunction with California State University Northridge, is committed to upholding and maintaining all aspects of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\nIf you are a student with a disability and wish to request accommodations, please contact the office of Students with Disabilities Resources located in 110 Student Services Building, or call (818) 677-2684 for an appointment. Any information regarding your disability will remain confidential. Because many accommodations require early planning, requests for accommodations should be made as early as possible. Any requests for accommodations will be reviewed in a timely manner to determine their appropriateness to this setting.\n\n\nAcademic Dishonesty\nPlease, stop and read the information below; this is important!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nEach student is expected to be familiar with, and abide by, the conditions of student conduct, as presented in the CSUN Catalog, with emphasis on sections entitled, Student Conduct Code, Academic Dishonesty, Faculty Policy on Academic Dishonesty, and Penalties. Any student engaging in academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism) is subject to discipline, which may include a failing grade in the course, and may also be subject to more severe discipline by the University. Students are encouraged to visit the link below and become familiar with the Standards for Student Conduct.\nhttp://www.csun.edu/a&r/soc/studentconduct.html\n\n\n\nAbout Plagiarism\nPlagiarism means using words, ideas, or arguments from another person or source without citation2. Cite all sources consulted to any extent (including material from the internet), whether or not assigned and whether or not quoted directly. For quotations, four or more words used in sequence must be set off in quotation marks, with the source identified.\nPlagiarism is a serious violation of the CSUN Student Conduct Code. Please read my comment about plagiarism under Homeworks. Any form of cheating will immediately earn you a failing grade for the entire course. By remaining enrolled, you consent to this policy.\n\nTurnitin (see below) will detect such misconducts as it checks every submission against a database of papers, as well as against the Internet.\n\nWhat is Turnitin?\nTurnitin is an automated system that instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student’s assignment with billions of websites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit assignments through the Canvas Assignment Tool in electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as an instructor, I receive a report from Turnitin that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment."

Any student engaging in academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism) is subject to discipline, which may include a failing grade in the course, and may also be subject to more severe discipline by the University. Students are encouraged to visit the link below and become familiar with the Standards for Student Conduct.\nhttp://www.csun.edu/a&r/soc/studentconduct.html\n\n\n\nAbout Plagiarism\nPlagiarism means using words, ideas, or arguments from another person or source without citation2. Cite all sources consulted to any extent (including material from the internet), whether or not assigned and whether or not quoted directly. For quotations, four or more words used in sequence must be set off in quotation marks, with the source identified.\nPlagiarism is a serious violation of the CSUN Student Conduct Code. Please read my comment about plagiarism under Homeworks. Any form of cheating will immediately earn you a failing grade for the entire course. By remaining enrolled, you consent to this policy.\n\nTurnitin (see below) will detect such misconducts as it checks every submission against a database of papers, as well as against the Internet.\n\nWhat is Turnitin?\nTurnitin is an automated system that instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student’s assignment with billions of websites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit assignments through the Canvas Assignment Tool in electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as an instructor, I receive a report from Turnitin that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment."

Note that CSUN students are eligible to check out tech devices from CSUN at NO COST.\n\n\nMini Juggling Balls\nOne of the requirements of this course is to learn a motor skill. If you select juggling, I suggest you to acquire the mini juggling balls, which are small and have the recommended weight for beginners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you choose to use any object other than the mini juggling balls, then you understand that your performance may be negativelly affected by it. When performing the exchange technique (required for this activity), at a given point, performers need to hold two objects in one hand. This becomes a problem if large objects are being used; i.e., tennis balls.\n\n\n\n\nSpeed Stacks Sport Stacking Set\nIf you choose to learn the cup stacking, I recommend you to acquire the cups used in national and international tournaments, or grab a set of less expensive ones from Amazon or elsewhere.\n\nDO NOT USE ORDINARY PLASTIC CUPS WHEN PRACTICING AS THEY ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR CUP STACKING. These cups will significantly affect your performance and your grade, in case you choose cup stacking as your learning task."

If you still question the way it’s phrased, rewrite it.\nContribute regularly to group dialogue, including discussion posts and replies.

Students will be introduced to concepts such as reliability, validity, measures of central tendency, variability, probability, and statistical techniques including: t tests (independent & dependent samples), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Chi-square, correlation, and regression.\nStudents are expected to take the material/concepts presented in this course and apply them through a series of homework assignments and quizzes. The overall goal of the course is not only to help students understand the mathematical/statistical concepts presented but also to assist in the application of these procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI reserve the right to make changes to this syllabus at any point in the semester. I will inform you in class and via email and an updated syllabus will be posted on Canvas."

    "text": "Structure & Requirements\nYou are responsible for the material covered in the textbook prior to attending each class. Note that the week’s readings are specified in the course sequence.\nIn addition to these readings, the instructor may assign supplemental readings throughout the semester. These supplemental readings do not appear on the schedule as these readings will be assigned at the instructor’s discretion.\nThe assignments used to enhance your learning experience in this course include:\n\nPreparedness\nYou will be evaluated on your preparedness by submitting an assignment before each class (Major Takeaways).\n\n\nParticipation & Attendance\nClass presence and participation points are given to encourage your active class participation and discussion. You will be rewarded with a perfect score as long as you frequently come to class and actively contribute to the class discussion during lectures.\nAlthough it is not required, most students send their professor a brief e-mail to explain their absence in advance.\n\n\nQuizzes\nBefore each class, you will complete a multiple-choice quiz on the topic covered for that week. You will be given multiples attempts and the highest grade will be used.\n\n\nHomeworks\nStudents will complete three (3) homework assignments on this course. The purpose of each assignment is to assist students in applying their understanding of the statistical procedures discussed in class as well as to provide an opportunity for students to respond to the readings.\nHomework assignments have two components. The first part is performing the statistical calculations correctly using jamovi. The second component involves interpreting the statistical analyses. When answering the interpretation questions, the point is to show that you know what your numbers mean, so don’t simply provide the definition of the term. For instance, if you calculate the “number needed to treat (NNT)” as NNT = 7.69, the interpretation of this number is something like “7.69 people must be given the treatment to prevent one adverse event. The wrong answer is something like”the NNT tells you how many people must be given the treatment to prevent one adverse event.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou are allowed to discuss homework with other students (and with the instructor), but you must write final answers yourself, in your own words. Solutions prepared “in committee” or by copying or paraphrasing someone else’s work are not acceptable; your hand-in assignments must represent your own thoughts (refer to [Academic Dishonesty Policy](#dishonesty) for more information); especially, the information about PLAGIARISM.\n\n\n\n\nExams\nYou will be required to complete two (2) exams in this course. Students may use their notes and textbook for the exams, but no other outside resource other than a calculator can be used.\nEach exam have 10 questions, with each question worth 10 points. Exams must be completed in the allotted time. The focus of the exams (and quizzes) will be on concepts and interpretation, with most of the computational activities occurring in the homework assignments.\nAlthough the quizzes and exams will not focus on previously tested material (they are not meant to be cumulative), knowledge of previously tested material may be inherently required to answer questions related to new material.\nMost of the computational activities will be via the homework assignments. In addition, selected readings will be assigned through the semester. The content of these readings will be included on exam and quiz questions and in homework assignments."

Each person is in one of several groups and we want to know whether these groups have different mean scores on some outcome variable.\nIn this lessons, I’ll discuss a broader class of experimental designs known as factorial designs, in which we have more than one independent variable (also known as Two-Way ANOVA).\nPreviously we were dealing with one single dependent variable and one single independent variable (2 or 3+ levels). But what if you have more than one IV/grouping variable? Factorial ANOVA is used in instances when there is more than one “factor” of interest; i.e., treatment & sex. The goal is to know the simultaneously effects of several FACTORS on the dependent variable. Thus, from now on, I will refer to it as F-ANOVA."

The idea behind the \\eta^2 is that, when measuring the effect size for a particular term (say, the main effect of Factor A), you want to deliberately ignore the other effects in the model (e.g., the main effect of Factor B).\nThat is, you would pretend that the effect of all these other terms is zero, and then calculate what the \\eta^2-value would have been. This is actually pretty easy to calculate. All you have to do is remove the sum of squares associated with the other terms from the denominator. In other words, if you want the partial η² for the main effect of Factor A, the denominator is just the sum of the SS values for Factor A and the residuals.[1]"

    "section": "Example",
    "text": "Example\n\nData set\nYou can download either the jamovi template or the data set as csv for this example. Then proceed to open the file with jamovi. The data set comes from Weir and Vincent (2021)[2].\n\nIn this design, the researcher wanted to study the effect of 1 day, 3 days, or 5 days of practice per week (20 minutes per day) on the learning of a novel task of nondominant arm throwing accuracy (the dependent variable). In addition, the researcher wanted to know whether subjects with athletic experience (college-level varsity athletes) benefit differently from the various practice conditions than do college students with no experience in athletic competition.[2(p. 181)]\n\nBecause in the example above the researcher wants to test the effect of two independent variables (factors) on a single dependent variable and both factors are between-subjects, we need to use the Between-Between F-ANOVA. This is an example of 3 (practice conditions) x 2 (athletic experience) with equal number of participants in each group (balanced design).\n\nThree subjects in each group were then randomly assigned to one of the three practice conditions (1, 3, or 5 days of practice per week for 20 minutes per day). Number of days of practice was identified as factor B. Subjects’ scores on the throwing task at the end of 6 weeks were recorded as the dependent variable. The scores ranged from 1 to 10 (10 = high).[2(p. 181)]\n\nStep 1: Set up hypotheses and determine the level of significance\nAssume that Factor A refers to Experience and Factor B refers to Practice. Each of the H_0 below will be tested at alpha = 0.05.\nNull hypothesis\nFactor A\nH_0:\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 - There is no difference in the means of factor A\nFactor B\nH_0:\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 - There is no difference in the means of factor B\nInteraction\nH_0: There is no interaction between factors A and B\nAlternative hypothesis\nFactor A\nH_a:\\bar{x}_1 \\neq \\bar{x}_2 - The means are not equal\nFactor B\nH_a:\\bar{x}_1 \\neq \\bar{x}_2 \\neq \\bar{x}_3 - The means are not equal\nInteraction3\nH_a: There is an interaction between factors A and B\nStep 2: Select the appropriate test statistic\nBetween-Between F-ANOVA\n\ncomparing means\ntwo IVs and one DV\nthe IVs are independent groups (between-subjects)\n\nStep 3: Set the decision rule\nFactor A: Reject H_0 is p-value is less than 0.05\nFactor B: Reject H_0 is p-value is less than 0.05\nInteraction: Reject H_0 is p-value is less than 0.05\nStep 4: Compute the test statistic\nSet up\nIn jamovi, choose Analyses > ANOVA > ANOVA. Then, move Throwing Accuracy to the Dependent Variable box. Finally, move Experience and Practice to the Fixed Factors box.\nBecause we have more that one factor, we want to use the partial eta-squared (\\eta^2) as a measure of effect size. Simply check the box Partial \\eta^2 under Effect Size.\n\n\nFigure 1: Between-Between F-ANOVA test set up\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: F-ANOVA table\n\n\n\n\nChecking the assumptions\nBefore we interpret the ANOVA table (see Figure 2), we need to check if all assumptions have been met.\n\nIndependence. In their description of the study, the authors mentioned that participants were randomly assigned to different groups; this assumption has been met.\nOutliers: Create boxplots for each factor. In jamovi, choose Exploration > Descriptive Statistics. Based on the boxplots below, there is no evidence of extreme outliers; thus, we will assume that this assumption has been met.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormality. Upon looking the results of the Shapiro-Wilk test, we conclude that this assumption has been met (p > 0.05). However, others would argue the need to check normality for each combination of the groups of the two independent variables.\nHomogeneity of variance. There needs to be homogeneity of variances for each combination of the groups of the two independent variables. According to the Levene’s test, this assumption has been met (p > 0.05).\n\n\nStep 5: Conclusion - make a decision to whether reject or retain the null hypotheses\n\nMain effect for Experience\nBy looking at the table above, and conclude that there is a Main Effect for factor A (Experience), F(12, 1) = 13.50, p = .003. This indicates that for all three levels of factor B combined, athletes scored significantly better than non-athletes (see Figure 3).\n\n\nFigure 3: Main effect for Experience\n\n\n\nMain effect for Practice\nThere was also a main effect for factor B (Practice), F(12, 2) = 30.29, p < .001. This indicates that for both levels of A combined, a significant difference exists somewhere among the three levels of B. By looking at\n\n\nFigure 4: Main effect for Practice\n\n\n\nInteraction effect\nFinally, there was an interaction effect; F(12, 2) = 4.62, p = .032. This indicates that the effect of practice on throwing accuracy differ in athletes and non-athletes. Figure 5 below suggests that the effect of more days of practice on throwing accuracy is larger in the athletes than in the non-athletes. The significant F for the interaction tells us that the lines in Figure 5 are not statistically parallel.\nAlthough I present the results for both main effects above, arguably, “we must be cautious interpreting the main effects”[2(p. 184)]. This is because the Interaction Effect was significant. In fact, some would suggest[3] to skip the interpretation of the Main Effects if the Interaction effect is significant as it could be misleading.\nUse a step-down process to interpret the results. This means you should evaluate the main effects and interaction, and only proceed to further analysis (post hoc tests) if there is significance.\nA significant interaction tells us that the effects of factor A differs across levels of factor B (and vice-versa).\nThe significant F (F = 4.63, p = .03) for the interaction tells us that the effects of practice on throwing accuracy differ in athletes and nonathletes.\nWe could stop the interaction interpretation right here and simply note that the significant interaction indicates that athletes improve more with more practice than do non-athletes. However, we are often interested is delineating the specific mean differences in the cell means.\nWe can do this performing simple effects tests; see table below.\nSimple effects for A (Experience)\nF across A at B1 > p = .730\nF across A at B2 > p = .008\nF across A at B3 > p = .004\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Interaction effect\n\n\n\nPost Hoc tests\nBecause Practice has more than two levels, we need to perform further analysis by running post hoc tests for the Factor Practice as well as for the Interaction.\nPost hoc tests for Practice\n\nEstimated Marginal Means\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

We are working together to support the successful achievement of our learning outcomes.\nLog-in and participate regularly to group conversations and activities.\nTreat the diverse contributions made by other community members with respect.\nHave patience and a sense of humor with technology.\nBe a learner. Keep an open mind when introduced to new ideas that may challenge your perceptions.\nAsk for help when you need it, and assist others when possible.\nUnderstand that communications shared through text have a higher likelihood of being misinterpreted than words that are spoken. Therefore, when you type a thought or a comment, read it carefully before you submit it. If you question the way it is worded, read it out loud to yourself. If you still question the way it’s phrased, rewrite it.\nContribute regularly to group dialogue, including discussion posts and replies. The contributions of each individual plays a role in the collective strength and diversity of our community.\nIf, at any time, you feel that any of these ground rules has been violated by a member of our community, you are encouraged to bring your concern directly and immediately to Dr. Furtado. Clearly identify which ground rule has been violated and include specific evidence of the violation in your e-mail or phone call. Your concerns will be addressed promptly and in an individualized manner."
