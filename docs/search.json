    "text": "Multiple regression, and multiple correlation, are tools used to examine the combined relations between multiple predictors and a dependent variable. When correlating one quantitative dependent variable (Yi) with multiple quantitative variables (Xi_1, Xi_2,... Xi_k ).\nit is specially useful when several independent variables work better at predicting a dependent variable compared to a single independent variable. For example, one can estimate percent body fat using the skinfold measurement technique. Although there are several techniques to estimate body site, researchers have used multiple regression techniques to identify the best predictors. See excerpt below:\n\nThe practical equation including age, race, height, weight and waist circumference had high predictive ability for lean body mass (men: R 2=0·91, standard error of estimate (SEE)=2·6 kg; women: R 2=0·85, SEE=2·4 kg) and fat mass (men: R 2=0·90, SEE=2·6 kg; women: R 2=0·93, SEE=2·4 kg). Waist circumference was a strong predictor in men only. Addition of other circumference and skinfold measures slightly improved the prediction model. ref needed"

It’s actually okay if the predictors X and the outcome Y are non-normal, so long as the residuals are normal.\nLinearity. Assumes that the relationship between X and Y is linear (both simple regression or a multiple regression).\nHomogeneity of variance. The regression model assumes that each residual is comes from a normal distribution with mean 0, and with a standard deviation that is the same for every single residual. In practice, it’s impossible to test the assumption that every residual is identically distributed. Instead, what we care about is that the standard deviation of the residual is the same for all values of \\hat{Y}, and all values of every predictor Xi in the model.\nIndependence. The residuals are independent of one another.\n\nAlso, pay attention to the following:\nUncorrelated predictors. In a multiple regression model, you don’t want your predictors to be too strongly correlated with each other. Predictors that are too strongly correlated with each other (referred to as “collinearity”) can cause problems when evaluating the model.\nNo “bad” outliers. There is an implicit assumption that your regression model isn’t being too strongly influenced by one or two anomalous data points. This raises questions about the adequacy of the model and the trustworthiness of the data in some cases."

Each person is in one of several groups and we want to know whether these groups have different mean scores on some outcome variable.\nIn this lessons, I’ll discuss a broader class of experimental designs known as factorial designs, in which we have more than one independent variable (also known as Two-Way ANOVA).\nPreviously we were dealing with one single dependent variable and one single independent variable (2 or 3+ levels). But what if you have more than one IV/grouping variable? Factorial ANOVA is used in instances when there is more than one “factor” of interest; i.e., treatment & sex. The goal is to know the simultaneously effects of several FACTORS on the dependent variable. Thus, from now on, I will refer to it as F-ANOVA."

The idea behind the \\eta^2 is that, when measuring the effect size for a particular term (say, the main effect of Factor A), you want to deliberately ignore the other effects in the model (e.g., the main effect of Factor B).\nThat is, you would pretend that the effect of all these other terms is zero, and then calculate what the \\eta^2-value would have been. This is actually pretty easy to calculate. All you have to do is remove the sum of squares associated with the other terms from the denominator. In other words, if you want the partial η² for the main effect of Factor A, the denominator is just the sum of the SS values for Factor A and the residuals.[1]"

In addition, the researcher wanted to know whether subjects with athletic experience (college-level varsity athletes) benefit differently from the various practice conditions than do college students with no experience in athletic competition.[2(p. 181)]\n\nBecause in the example above the researcher wants to test the effect of two independent variables (factors) on a single dependent variable and both factors are between-subjects, we need to use the Between-Between F-ANOVA. This is an example of 3 (practice conditions) x 2 (athletic experience) with equal number of participants in each group (balanced design).\n\nThree subjects in each group were then randomly assigned to one of the three practice conditions (1, 3, or 5 days of practice per week for 20 minutes per day). Number of days of practice was identified as factor B. Subjects’ scores on the throwing task at the end of 6 weeks were recorded as the dependent variable. The scores ranged from 1 to 10 (10 = high).[2(p. 181)]\n\nStep 1: Set up hypotheses and determine the level of significance\nAssume that Factor A refers to Experience and Factor B refers to Practice. Each of the H_0 below will be tested at alpha = 0.05.\nNull hypothesis\nFactor A\nH_0:\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 - There is no difference in the means of factor A\nFactor B\nH_0:\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 - There is no difference in the means of factor B\nInteraction\nH_0: There is no interaction between factors A and B\nAlternative hypothesis\nFactor A\nH_a:\\bar{x}_1 \\neq \\bar{x}_2 - The means are not equal\nFactor B\nH_a:\\bar{x}_1 \\neq \\bar{x}_2 \\neq \\bar{x}_3 - The means are not equal\nInteraction3\nH_a: There is an interaction between factors A and B\nStep 2: Select the appropriate test statistic\nBetween-Between F-ANOVA\n\ncomparing means\ntwo IVs and one DV\nthe IVs are independent groups (between-subjects)\n\nStep 3: Set the decision rule\nFactor A: Reject H_0 is p-value is less than 0.05\nFactor B: Reject H_0 is p-value is less than 0.05\nInteraction: Reject H_0 is p-value is less than 0.05\nStep 4: Compute the test statistic\nSet up\nIn jamovi, choose Analyses > ANOVA > ANOVA. Then, move Throwing Accuracy to the Dependent Variable box. Finally, move Experience and Practice to the Fixed Factors box.\nBecause we have more that one factor, we want to use the partial eta-squared (\\eta^2) as a measure of effect size. Simply check the box Partial \\eta^2 under Effect Size.\n\n\nFigure 1: Between-Between F-ANOVA test set up\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: F-ANOVA table\n\n\n\n\nChecking the assumptions\nBefore we interpret the ANOVA table (see Figure 2), we need to check if all assumptions have been met.\n\nIndependence. In their description of the study, the authors mentioned that participants were randomly assigned to different groups; this assumption has been met.\nOutliers: Create boxplots for each factor. In jamovi, choose Exploration > Descriptive Statistics. Based on the boxplots below, there is no evidence of extreme outliers; thus, we will assume that this assumption has been met.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormality. Upon looking the results of the Shapiro-Wilk test, we conclude that this assumption has been met (p > 0.05). However, others would argue the need to check normality for each combination of the groups of the two independent variables.\nHomogeneity of variance. There needs to be homogeneity of variances for each combination of the groups of the two independent variables. According to the Levene’s test, this assumption has been met (p > 0.05).\n\n\nStep 5: Conclusion - make a decision to whether reject or retain the null hypotheses\n\nMain effect for Experience\nBy looking at the table above, and conclude that there is a Main Effect for factor A (Experience), F(12, 1) = 13.50, p = .003. This indicates that for all three levels of factor B combined, athletes scored significantly better than non-athletes (see Figure 3).\n\n\nFigure 3: Main effect for Experience\n\n\n\nMain effect for Practice\nThere was also a main effect for factor B (Practice), F(12, 2) = 30.29, p < .001. This indicates that for both levels of A combined, a significant difference exists somewhere among the three levels of B. By looking at\n\n\nFigure 4: Main effect for Practice\n\n\n\nInteraction effect\nFinally, there was an interaction effect; F(12, 2) = 4.62, p = .032. This indicates that the effect of practice on throwing accuracy differ in athletes and non-athletes. Figure 5 below suggests that the effect of more days of practice on throwing accuracy is larger in the athletes than in the non-athletes. The significant F for the interaction tells us that the lines in Figure 5 are not statistically parallel.\nAlthough I present the results for both main effects above, arguably, “we must be cautious interpreting the main effects”[2(p. 184)]. This is because the Interaction Effect was significant. In fact, some would suggest[3] to skip the interpretation of the Main Effects if the Interaction effect is significant as it could be misleading.\nUse a step-down process to interpret the results. This means you should evaluate the main effects and interaction, and only proceed to further analysis (post hoc tests) if there is significance.\nA significant interaction tells us that the effects of factor A differs across levels of factor B (and vice-versa).\nThe significant F (F = 4.63, p = .03) for the interaction tells us that the effects of practice on throwing accuracy differ in athletes and nonathletes.\nWe could stop the interaction interpretation right here and simply note that the significant interaction indicates that athletes improve more with more practice than do non-athletes. However, we are often interested is delineating the specific mean differences in the cell means.\nWe can do this performing simple effects tests; see table below.\nSimple effects for A (Experience)\nF across A at B1 > p = .730\nF across A at B2 > p = .008\nF across A at B3 > p = .004\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Interaction effect\n\n\n\nPost Hoc tests\nBecause Practice has more than two levels, we need to perform further analysis by running post hoc tests for the Factor Practice as well as for the Interaction.\nPost hoc tests for Practice\n\nEstimated Marginal Means"

When correlating one quantitative dependent variable (Yi) with multiple quantitative variables (Xi_1, Xi_2,... Xi_k ).\nMultiple regression is specially useful when several independent variables work better at predicting a dependent variable compared to a single independent variable. For example, one can estimate percent body fat using the skinfold measurement technique. Although there are several techniques to estimate body fat, researchers have used the multiple regression technique to identify the best predictors. See excerpt below:\n\nThe practical equation including age, race, height, weight and waist circumference had high predictive ability for lean body mass (men: R 2=0·91, standard error of estimate (SEE)=2·6 kg; women: R 2=0·85, SEE=2·4 kg) and fat mass (men: R 2=0·90, SEE=2·6 kg; women: R 2=0·93, SEE=2·4 kg). Waist circumference was a strong predictor in men only. Addition of other circumference and skinfold measures slightly improved the prediction model. ref needed"

It’s actually okay if the predictors X and the outcome Y are non-normal, so long as the residuals are normal.\nLinearity. Assumes that the relationship between X and Y is linear (both simple regression or a multiple regression).\nHomogeneity of variance. The regression model assumes that each residual is comes from a normal distribution with mean 0, and with a standard deviation that is the same for every single residual. In practice, it’s impossible to test the assumption that every residual is identically distributed. Instead, what we care about is that the standard deviation of the residual is the same for all values of \\hat{Y}, and all values of every predictor Xi in the model.\nIndependence. The residuals are independent of one another.\n\nAlso, pay attention to the following:\nUncorrelated predictors. In a multiple regression model, you don’t want your predictors to be too strongly correlated with each other. Predictors that are too strongly correlated with each other (referred to as “collinearity”) can cause problems when evaluating the model.\nNo “bad” outliers. There is an implicit assumption that your regression model isn’t being too strongly influenced by one or two anomalous data points. This raises questions about the adequacy of the model and the trustworthiness of the data in some cases."

Note that the week’s readings are specified in the course sequence.\nIn addition to these readings, the instructor may assign supplemental readings throughout the semester. These supplemental readings do not appear on the schedule as these readings will be assigned at the instructor’s discretion.\nThe assignments used to enhance your learning experience in this course include:\n\nPreparedness\nYou will be evaluated on your preparedness by submitting an assignment before each class (Major Takeaways).\n\n\nParticipation & Attendance\nClass presence and participation points are given to encourage your active class participation and discussion. You will be rewarded with a perfect score as long as you frequently come to class and actively contribute to the class discussion during lectures.\nAlthough it is not required, most students send their professor a brief e-mail to explain their absence in advance.\n\n\nQuizzes\nBefore each class, you will complete a multiple-choice quiz on the topic covered for that week. You will be given multiples attempts and the highest grade will be used.\n\n\nHomeworks\nStudents will complete three (3) homework assignments on this course. The purpose of each assignment is to assist students in applying their understanding of the statistical procedures discussed in class as well as to provide an opportunity for students to respond to the readings.\nHomework assignments have two components. The first part is performing the statistical calculations correctly using jamovi. The second component involves interpreting the statistical analyses. When answering the interpretation questions, the point is to show that you know what your numbers mean, so don’t simply provide the definition of the term. For instance, if you calculate the “number needed to treat (NNT)” as NNT = 7.69, the interpretation of this number is something like “7.69 people must be given the treatment to prevent one adverse event. The wrong answer is something like”the NNT tells you how many people must be given the treatment to prevent one adverse event.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou are allowed to discuss homework with other students (and with the instructor), but you must write final answers yourself, in your own words. Solutions prepared “in committee” or by copying or paraphrasing someone else’s work are not acceptable; your hand-in assignments must represent your own thoughts (refer to [Academic Dishonesty Policy](#dishonesty) for more information); especially, the information about PLAGIARISM.\n\n\n\n\nExams\nYou will be required to complete two (2) exams in this course. Students may use their notes and textbook for the exams, but no other outside resource other than a calculator can be used.\nEach exam have 10 questions, with each question worth 10 points. Exams must be completed in the allotted time. The focus of the exams (and quizzes) will be on concepts and interpretation, with most of the computational activities occurring in the homework assignments.\nAlthough the quizzes and exams will not focus on previously tested material (they are not meant to be cumulative), knowledge of previously tested material may be inherently required to answer questions related to new material.\nMost of the computational activities will be via the homework assignments. In addition, selected readings will be assigned through the semester. The content of these readings will be included on exam and quiz questions and in homework assignments."

These e-mails tend to be expressive utility on the part of the student and do not require a response from me. Students interested in improving their knowledge of material should see me during office hours.\nThe student is requesting an extension on an assignment for which the syllabus already established the deadline.

Any student engaging in academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism) is subject to discipline, which may include a failing grade in the course, and may also be subject to more severe discipline by the University. Students are encouraged to visit the link below and become familiar with the Standards for Student Conduct.\nhttp://www.csun.edu/a&r/soc/studentconduct.html\n\n\n\nAbout Plagiarism\nPlagiarism means using words, ideas, or arguments from another person or source without citation3. Cite all sources consulted to any extent (including material from the internet), whether or not assigned and whether or not quoted directly. For quotations, four or more words used in sequence must be set off in quotation marks, with the source identified.\nPlagiarism is a serious violation of the CSUN Student Conduct Code. Please read my comment about plagiarism under Homeworks. Any form of cheating will immediately earn you a failing grade for the entire course. By remaining enrolled, you consent to this policy.\n\nTurnitin (see below) will detect such misconducts as it checks every submission against a database of papers, as well as against the Internet.\n\nWhat is Turnitin?\nTurnitin is an automated system that instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student’s assignment with billions of websites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit assignments through the Canvas Assignment Tool in electronic format.

Many times new online learners expect them to be easier than face-to-face classes and are surprised to learn how time intensive they are.\nPlan your schedule to ensure you have approximately 10 hours per week to spend on this class and take time to identify where and when you’ll do your learning.\nReview the due dates for the assignments (see Calendar) to orient yourself to the flow of the learning. 4. This course requires regular engagement throughout each week. Plan to reserve a few hours each day to practice the skill you selected for the Learning Task assignment."

    "text": "Online Etiquette\nAll learners in this course will expect to abide by our community ground rules (see below).\nGround Rules: In an effort to ensure our learning community develops, thrives and sustains throughout our time together, the following ground rules will be in effect at all times.\n\nConsider yourself a member of a community. A community is a group of individuals who work together to support a common goal or interest. We are working together to support the successful achievement of our learning outcomes.\nLog-in and participate regularly to group conversations and activities.\nTreat the diverse contributions made by other community members with respect.\nHave patience and a sense of humor with technology.\nBe a learner. Keep an open mind when introduced to new ideas that may challenge your perceptions.\nAsk for help when you need it, and assist others when possible.\nUnderstand that communications shared through text have a higher likelihood of being misinterpreted than words that are spoken. Therefore, when you type a thought or a comment, read it carefully before you submit it. If you question the way it is worded, read it out loud to yourself. If you still question the way it’s phrased, rewrite it.\nContribute regularly to group dialogue, including discussion posts and replies. The contributions of each individual plays a role in the collective strength and diversity of our community.\nIf, at any time, you feel that any of these ground rules has been violated by a member of our community, you are encouraged to bring your concern directly and immediately to Dr. Furtado. Clearly identify which ground rule has been violated and include specific evidence of the violation in your e-mail or phone call. Your concerns will be addressed promptly and in an individualized manner."
