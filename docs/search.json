    "section": "Structure & Requirements",
    "text": "Structure & Requirements\nYou are responsible for the material covered in the textbook prior to attending each class. Note that the week’s readings are specified in the course sequence.\nIn addition to these readings, the instructor may assign supplemental readings throughout the semester. These supplemental readings do not appear on the schedule as these readings will be assigned at the instructor’s discretion.\nThe assignments used to enhance your learning experience in this course include:\n\nPreparedness\nYou will be evaluated on your preparedness by submitting an assignment before each class (Major Takeaways).\n\n\nParticipation & Attendance\nClass presence and participation points are given to encourage your active class participation and discussion. You will be rewarded with a perfect score as long as you frequently come to class and actively contribute to the class discussion during lectures.\nAlthough it is not required, most students send their professor a brief e-mail to explain their absence in advance.\n\n\nQuizzes\nBefore each class, you will complete a multiple-choice quiz on the topic covered for that week. You will be given multiples attempts and the highest grade will be used.\n\n\nHomeworks\nStudents will complete three (3) homework assignments on this course. The purpose of each assignment is to assist students in applying their understanding of the statistical procedures discussed in class as well as to provide an opportunity for students to respond to the readings.\nHomework assignments have two components. The first part is performing the statistical calculations correctly using jamovi. The second component involves interpreting the statistical analyses. When answering the interpretation questions, the point is to show that you know what your numbers mean, so don’t simply provide the definition of the term. For instance, if you calculate the “number needed to treat (NNT)” as NNT = 7.69, the interpretation of this number is something like “7.69 people must be given the treatment to prevent one adverse event. The wrong answer is something like”the NNT tells you how many people must be given the treatment to prevent one adverse event.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou are allowed to discuss homework with other students (and with the instructor), but you must write final answers yourself, in your own words. Solutions prepared “in committee” or by copying or paraphrasing someone else’s work are not acceptable; your hand-in assignments must represent your own thoughts (refer to [Academic Dishonesty Policy](#dishonesty) for more information); especially, the information about PLAGIARISM.\n\n\n\n\nExams\nYou will be required to complete two (2) exams in this course. Students may use their notes and textbook for the exams, but no other outside resource other than a calculator can be used.\nEach exam have 10 questions, with each question worth 10 points. Exams must be completed in the allotted time. The focus of the exams (and quizzes) will be on concepts and interpretation, with most of the computational activities occurring in the homework assignments.\nAlthough the quizzes and exams will not focus on previously tested material (they are not meant to be cumulative), knowledge of previously tested material may be inherently required to answer questions related to new material.\nMost of the computational activities will be via the homework assignments. In addition, selected readings will be assigned through the semester. The content of these readings will be included on exam and quiz questions and in homework assignments."

Basically, don’t cheat and try to learn stuff.\n\nGrading\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nMajor Takeaways (14)*\n15%\n\n\nParticipation & Attendance\n5%\n\n\nWeekly Quizzes (14)*\n20%\n\n\nHomeworks (3)\n30%\n\n\nExams (2)\n30%\n\n\n\n*The lowest score will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nGrading Scale\nA 93.00-100.00 | A- 90.00-92.99 B+ 87.00-89.99 | B 83.00-86.99 | B- 80.00-82.99 C+ 77.00-79.99 | C 73.00-76.99 | C- 70.00-72.99 D+ 67.00-69.99 | D 63.00-66.99 | D- 60.00-62.99 F <59.99\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn recognition of the fact that grading, however carefully done, will always be imperfect, this class will utilize a “round up” rule for assigning final grades. I will round up from .5% and above, but anything below this will round down. In other words, 79.5 will round up to 80, while 79.4 will round down to 79 even.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRequests for an Incomplete (I) must conform to university policies. Among other requirements, “I” is possible only for instances in which you are demonstrating passing work in the class.\n\n\n\n\nAttendance\n\nShowing up is 80 percent of life – Woody Allen, via Marshall Brickman\n\nAttendance will be taken at the beginning of every class; please, plan accordingly.\n\n\nE-mail\nWhile taking this course, only communicate with me via Canvas > Inbox.\nIf your message concerns a non-private matter (i.e., assignments, content, deadlines, etc.), then please post your question to the Q&A Forum (Canvas > Discussions > Q&A Forum), which can be answered by any student taking the course.\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\nIn-person\nTuesdays from 9-11 am at RE 289.\n\n\nOnline via Zoom\nBy appointment only via https://calendly.com/drfurtado\n\n\n\nLate Assignments\nUnless you have made previous arrangements, a late assignments will be docked 10% per day (first 4 days) it is late. Students will not be allowed to submit assignments after the fourth day of the deadline.\n\n\nExtra Credit\nThere is no individual extra credit granted. Therefore, do not plan to make-up poor grades at the end of the semester by asking to do extra credit work. I might provide extra credit opportunities, but these will be offered to the entire class, not to individuals.\n\n\nDisabilities\nFederal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level to qualified students with disabilities.\nThis instructor, in conjunction with California State University Northridge, is committed to upholding and maintaining all aspects of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\nIf you are a student with a disability and wish to request accommodations, please contact the office of Students with Disabilities Resources located in 110 Student Services Building, or call (818) 677-2684 for an appointment. Any information regarding your disability will remain confidential. Because many accommodations require early planning, requests for accommodations should be made as early as possible. Any requests for accommodations will be reviewed in a timely manner to determine their appropriateness to this setting.\n\n\nAcademic Dishonesty\nPlease, stop and read the information below; this is important!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nEach student is expected to be familiar with, and abide by, the conditions of student conduct, as presented in the CSUN Catalog, with emphasis on sections entitled, Student Conduct Code, Academic Dishonesty, Faculty Policy on Academic Dishonesty, and Penalties. Any student engaging in academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism) is subject to discipline, which may include a failing grade in the course, and may also be subject to more severe discipline by the University. Students are encouraged to visit the link below and become familiar with the Standards for Student Conduct.\nhttp://www.csun.edu/a&r/soc/studentconduct.html\n\n\n\nAbout Plagiarism\nPlagiarism means using words, ideas, or arguments from another person or source without citation2. Cite all sources consulted to any extent (including material from the internet), whether or not assigned and whether or not quoted directly. For quotations, four or more words used in sequence must be set off in quotation marks, with the source identified.\nPlagiarism is a serious violation of the CSUN Student Conduct Code. Please read my comment about plagiarism under Homeworks. Any form of cheating will immediately earn you a failing grade for the entire course. By remaining enrolled, you consent to this policy.\n\nTurnitin (see below) will detect such misconducts as it checks every submission against a database of papers, as well as against the Internet.\n\nWhat is Turnitin?\nTurnitin is an automated system that instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student’s assignment with billions of websites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit assignments through the Canvas Assignment Tool in electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as an instructor, I receive a report from Turnitin that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment."

Any student engaging in academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism) is subject to discipline, which may include a failing grade in the course, and may also be subject to more severe discipline by the University. Students are encouraged to visit the link below and become familiar with the Standards for Student Conduct.\nhttp://www.csun.edu/a&r/soc/studentconduct.html\n\n\n\nAbout Plagiarism\nPlagiarism means using words, ideas, or arguments from another person or source without citation2. Cite all sources consulted to any extent (including material from the internet), whether or not assigned and whether or not quoted directly. For quotations, four or more words used in sequence must be set off in quotation marks, with the source identified.\nPlagiarism is a serious violation of the CSUN Student Conduct Code. Please read my comment about plagiarism under Homeworks. Any form of cheating will immediately earn you a failing grade for the entire course. By remaining enrolled, you consent to this policy.\n\nTurnitin (see below) will detect such misconducts as it checks every submission against a database of papers, as well as against the Internet.\n\nWhat is Turnitin?\nTurnitin is an automated system that instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student’s assignment with billions of websites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit assignments through the Canvas Assignment Tool in electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as an instructor, I receive a report from Turnitin that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment."

Note that CSUN students are eligible to check out tech devices from CSUN at NO COST.\n\n\nMini Juggling Balls\nOne of the requirements of this course is to learn a motor skill. If you select juggling, I suggest you to acquire the mini juggling balls, which are small and have the recommended weight for beginners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you choose to use any object other than the mini juggling balls, then you understand that your performance may be negativelly affected by it. When performing the exchange technique (required for this activity), at a given point, performers need to hold two objects in one hand. This becomes a problem if large objects are being used; i.e., tennis balls.\n\n\n\n\nSpeed Stacks Sport Stacking Set\nIf you choose to learn the cup stacking, I recommend you to acquire the cups used in national and international tournaments, or grab a set of less expensive ones from Amazon or elsewhere.\n\nDO NOT USE ORDINARY PLASTIC CUPS WHEN PRACTICING AS THEY ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR CUP STACKING. These cups will significantly affect your performance and your grade, in case you choose cup stacking as your learning task."

If you still question the way it’s phrased, rewrite it.\nContribute regularly to group dialogue, including discussion posts and replies.

    "text": "Course Description\nThis course focuses on the introductory statistical techniques used in social science research. Students will be introduced to concepts such as reliability, validity, measures of central tendency, variability, probability, and statistical techniques including: t tests (independent & dependent samples), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Chi-square, correlation, and regression.\nStudents are expected to take the material/concepts presented in this course and apply them through a series of homework assignments and quizzes. The overall goal of the course is not only to help students understand the mathematical/statistical concepts presented but also to assist in the application of these procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI reserve the right to make changes to this syllabus at any point in the semester. I will inform you in class and via email and an updated syllabus will be posted on Canvas."

    "text": "Structure & Requirements\nYou are responsible for the material covered in the textbook prior to attending each class. Note that the week’s readings are specified in the course sequence.\nIn addition to these readings, the instructor may assign supplemental readings throughout the semester. These supplemental readings do not appear on the schedule as these readings will be assigned at the instructor’s discretion.\nThe assignments used to enhance your learning experience in this course include:\n\nPreparedness\nYou will be evaluated on your preparedness by submitting an assignment before each class (Major Takeaways).\n\n\nParticipation & Attendance\nClass presence and participation points are given to encourage your active class participation and discussion. You will be rewarded with a perfect score as long as you frequently come to class and actively contribute to the class discussion during lectures.\nAlthough it is not required, most students send their professor a brief e-mail to explain their absence in advance.\n\n\nQuizzes\nBefore each class, you will complete a multiple-choice quiz on the topic covered for that week. You will be given multiples attempts and the highest grade will be used.\n\n\nHomeworks\nStudents will complete three (3) homework assignments on this course. The purpose of each assignment is to assist students in applying their understanding of the statistical procedures discussed in class as well as to provide an opportunity for students to respond to the readings.\nHomework assignments have two components. The first part is performing the statistical calculations correctly using jamovi. The second component involves interpreting the statistical analyses. When answering the interpretation questions, the point is to show that you know what your numbers mean, so don’t simply provide the definition of the term. For instance, if you calculate the “number needed to treat (NNT)” as NNT = 7.69, the interpretation of this number is something like “7.69 people must be given the treatment to prevent one adverse event. The wrong answer is something like”the NNT tells you how many people must be given the treatment to prevent one adverse event.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou are allowed to discuss homework with other students (and with the instructor), but you must write final answers yourself, in your own words. Solutions prepared “in committee” or by copying or paraphrasing someone else’s work are not acceptable; your hand-in assignments must represent your own thoughts (refer to [Academic Dishonesty Policy](#dishonesty) for more information); especially, the information about PLAGIARISM.\n\n\n\n\nExams\nYou will be required to complete two (2) exams in this course. Students may use their notes and textbook for the exams, but no other outside resource other than a calculator can be used.\nEach exam have 10 questions, with each question worth 10 points. Exams must be completed in the allotted time. The focus of the exams (and quizzes) will be on concepts and interpretation, with most of the computational activities occurring in the homework assignments.\nAlthough the quizzes and exams will not focus on previously tested material (they are not meant to be cumulative), knowledge of previously tested material may be inherently required to answer questions related to new material.\nMost of the computational activities will be via the homework assignments. In addition, selected readings will be assigned through the semester. The content of these readings will be included on exam and quiz questions and in homework assignments."
