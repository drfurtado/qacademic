They serve a crucial function in in-text citations and reference list entries.\nIn in-text citations, page numbers allow readers to locate the exact spot within a source where the information being cited can be found. This is especially important for direct quotes and paraphrased material. Examples of in-text citations with page numbers include: (Smith, 2019, p. 27) and (Jones & Lee, 2020, pp. 45-46).\nIn reference list entries, page numbers allow readers to locate the specific pages or range of pages on which the information being cited appears. Examples of reference list entries with page numbers include:\n\nJournal article: Smith, J. D. (2019). The effects of caffeine on sleep patterns. Journal of Sleep Research, 28(3), 25-34.\nBook chapter: Jones, T. K., & Lee, S. M. (2020). The impact of technology on education. In P.

    "text": "Introduction to percentiles\n\nDefinition of percentiles\nA percentile is a measure used in statistics that indicates the value below which a certain percentage of observations in a group fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value below which 20% of the observations may be found. Percentiles can be used to compare the relative standing of a value within a dataset.\nFor example, if a student’s test score is in the 90th percentile, it means that the student scored higher than 90% of the other students who took the test. Percentiles can also be used to determine the distribution of values within a dataset. For example, if the majority of scores fall within the lower percentiles, it may indicate that the scores are generally lower, while if the majority of scores fall within the higher percentiles, it may indicate that the scores are generally higher.\nPercentiles can be calculated using a variety of methods, but one common method is to first arrange the data in order from smallest to largest and then identify the value that corresponds to the desired percentile.\n\n\nHow to calculate percentiles\nTo calculate percentiles, you need to follow these steps:\n\nRank the data: Arrange the data in numerical order from smallest to largest.\nDetermine the percentile rank: Percentile rank refers to the percentage of values in the data set that are less than or equal to a particular value. To determine the percentile rank for a specific value, divide the number of values that are less than or equal to the value by the total number of values in the data set, and then multiply by 100.\nFind the corresponding value: Once you have determined the percentile rank, you can use it to find the corresponding value in the data set. For example, if the percentile rank is 75, then the corresponding value would be the value that is greater than or equal to 75% of the values in the data set.\n\nHere’s an example to illustrate the process:\nSuppose you have the following data set:\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\nTo calculate the 75th percentile, you would first rank the data:\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\nThen, you would determine the percentile rank for the 75th percentile:\n75th percentile rank = (75/100) * 9 = 6.75\nThis means that the value that is greater than or equal to 75% of the values in the data set is the 7th value in the ranked data set (since the ranks start at 1). Therefore, the 75th percentile for this data set is 7."

    "text": "Uses of percentiles\n\nUnderstanding the distribution of data\nPercentile can be used to understand the distribution of data. It indicates the value below which a certain percentage of data falls. For example, if the 50th percentile of a dataset is 50, it means that 50% of the data falls below that value.\nTo understand the distribution of data using percentile, we can calculate the percentiles for different values in the dataset. For example, if we have a dataset of 100 values, we can calculate the 10th percentile, 25th percentile, 50th percentile (also known as the median), 75th percentile, and 90th percentile. These values will give us an idea of how the data is distributed.\nFor example, if the 10th percentile is 20 and the 90th percentile is 80, it means that 10% of the data falls below 20 and 90% of the data falls below 80. This indicates that the data is distributed relatively evenly, with a few outliers on either side. On the other hand, if the 10th percentile is 20 and the 90th percentile is 90, it means that there is a larger concentration of data towards the higher end of the scale.\nUsing percentile can help us understand the distribution of data and identify patterns or trends in the data. It can also be used to compare different datasets and see how they differ in terms of distribution.\n\n\nComparing data sets\nUsing percentiles can be a useful way to compare data sets because it allows you to see how a particular value in one dataset compares to values in another dataset. For example, if you have two datasets with different numbers of values, you can use percentiles to see how a particular value in one dataset compares to values in the other dataset. This can be especially useful when the datasets have different scales or units of measurement.\nFor example:\nTo calculate the percentile of a particular value in a dataset, you can use the following formula:\nPercentile = (Number of values below the given value / Total number of values) x 100\nFor example, let’s say you have a dataset with the following values: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10\nTo find the percentile of the value 7, you would count the number of values below 7, which is 2 (3 and 5). The total number of values in the dataset is 6. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:\nPercentile = (2 / 6) x 100 = 33.33\nThis means that the value 7 is at the 33.33rd percentile in the dataset."

    "text": "Percentile rank\n\nDefinition of percentile rank\nPercentile rank is a measure of the relative standing of a value in a dataset. It indicates the percentage of values in the dataset that are equal to or less than the value in question. For example, if a value has a percentile rank of 75, it means that 75% of the values in the dataset are equal to or less than that value.\nPercentile ranks are commonly used to describe how well a person has performed on a test or assessment relative to a group of people. For example, if a person scores in the 75th percentile on a test, it means that they scored higher than 75% of the people who took the test. Percentile ranks can also be used to compare the scores of different groups of people, such as comparing the scores of students in different schools or at different grade levels.\nIt’s important to note that percentile rank is different from percentage. Percentile rank describes the relative standing of a value within a dataset, while percentage is a measure of the number of items in a set relative to the total number of items.\n\n\nHow to calculate percentile rank\nPercentile rank is a way to determine the relative position of a score within a distribution of scores. It can be calculated by the following steps:\n\nOrganize the scores in the distribution in ascending order, with the lowest score at the bottom.\nDetermine the position of the score in question within this ordered distribution. For example, if there are 100 scores in the distribution and the score in question is the 50th, it is at the 50th percentile.\nCalculate the percentile rank as a percentage by dividing the position of the score in the distribution by the total number of scores and multiplying by 100. For example, if the score in question is the 50th out of 100 scores, its percentile rank would be 50/100 * 100 = 50%.\n\n\n\nExample of finding the percentile rank for a given score\nIt’s also possible to use a percentile rank calculator to determine the percentile rank for a given score and distribution of scores. These calculators can be found online or in statistical software.\nHere’s an example of how to calculate percentile rank:\nSuppose you have a distribution of scores for a group of students on a test, and you want to determine the percentile rank of a score of 80. The scores in the distribution are as follows:\n70, 72, 73, 75, 76, 78, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 82, 84, 85, 85, 87, 88, 88, 89, 90\nTo find the percentile rank of a score of 80, you would first put the scores in ascending order:\n70, 72, 73, 75, 76, 78, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 82, 84, 85, 85, 87, 88, 88, 89, 90\nThen you would determine the position of the score of 80 in the distribution: it is the 10th score out of 20 scores.\nFinally, you would calculate the percentile rank as a percentage by dividing the position of the score in the distribution by the total number of scores and multiplying by 100:\nPercentile rank = 10/20 * 100 = 50%\nThis means that a score of 80 is at the 50th percentile, which means that it is higher than 50% of the scores in the distribution."

    "text": "Percentiles in statistics software\n\nCalculating percentiles in Excel\nTo calculate percentiles in Excel, you can use the PERCENTILE function. The PERCENTILE function takes two arguments: an array of data and the percentile value that you want to calculate.\nFor example, suppose you have a range of data in cells A1:A10 and you want to calculate the 25th percentile. You can use the following formula:\n=PERCENTILE(A1:A10, 0.25)\nThis will return the value at the 25th percentile of the data in the range A1:A10.\nYou can also use the PERCENTILE.INC function to calculate percentiles, which is similar to the PERCENTILE function but calculates the percentile using inclusive interpolation. For example:\n=PERCENTILE.INC(A1:A10, 0.25)\nThis will also return the value at the 25th percentile of the data in the range A1:A10, but using inclusive interpolation.\nYou can use the PERCENTILE and PERCENTILE.INC functions to calculate other percentiles as well. Simply replace the percentile value in the formula with the desired percentile. For example, to calculate the 50th percentile (also known as the median), you can use:\n=PERCENTILE(A1:A10, 0.50)\nor\n=PERCENTILE.INC(A1:A10, 0.50)\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\nCalculating percentiles in SPSS\nTo calculate percentiles in SPSS, you can use the “Percentile” function. Here’s how:\n\nSelect “Transform” from the menu at the top of the SPSS window.\nClick “Rank Cases” from the dropdown menu.\nIn the “Rank Cases” dialog box, select the variable that you want to calculate percentiles for from the “Numeric Expression” box.\nIn the “Output Variable” box, enter a name for the new variable that will contain the percentile ranks.\nClick “OK” to compute the percentile ranks.\n\nOnce the percentile ranks have been calculated, you can use the “Frequency” function to see the percentiles. To do this:\n\nSelect “Analyze” from the menu at the top of the SPSS window.\nClick “Descriptive Statistics” and then “Frequencies” from the dropdown menu.\nIn the “Variable(s)” box, select the variable that contains the percentile ranks.\nClick “Statistics” and then check the “Percentiles” box.\nClick “OK” to see the percentiles in the output window.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the “Explore” function to see the percentiles. To do this:\n\nSelect “Analyze” from the menu at the top of the SPSS window.\nClick “Descriptive Statistics” and then “Explore” from the dropdown menu.\nIn the “Dependent List” box, select the variable that you want to calculate percentiles for.\nIn the “Statistics” box, check the “Percentiles” box.\nClick “OK” to see the percentiles in the output window.\n\n\n\nCalculating percentiles in jamovi\nTo calculate percentiles in jamovi, you can use the “Quantiles” module in the “Descriptives” module.\nHere’s how you can use it:\n\nOpen the “Descriptives” module in jamovi.\nSelect the “Quantiles” tab.\nIn the “Variable” field, select the variable for which you want to calculate percentiles.\nIn the “Quantiles” field, specify the percentiles you want to calculate. You can enter multiple percentiles separated by commas, or you can use the “All” option to calculate all percentiles from 0 to 100.\nClick the “Run” button to calculate the percentiles.\n\nThe results will be displayed in a table, with one row for each percentile that you specified. The table will include the percentile value, as well as the count and percentage of observations that are below that percentile.\nYou can also use the “Graph” tab in the “Descriptives” module to create a box plot or a histogram of the data, which can help you visualize the distribution of the data and identify any outliers.\n\n\nCalculating percentiles in R\nTo calculate percentiles in R, you can use the quantile() function. This function takes a numeric vector as its first argument and a probability (or quantile) as its second argument. It returns the value at the specified quantile of the input vector.\nFirst, we will create a vector x with \\(n\\) = 11.\n\nx &lt;- c(2,4,5,8,10,11,14,16,3,4,5)\n\nFor example, to calculate the 50th percentile (i.e., the median) of a vector x, you can use the following code:\n\nquantile(x, 0.5)\n\n50% \n  5 \n\n\nTo calculate other percentiles, you can specify the desired percentile as a decimal between 0 and 1. For example, to calculate the 75th percentile, you can use the following code:\n\nquantile(x, 0.75)\n\n 75% \n10.5 \n\n\nYou can also calculate multiple percentiles at once by passing a vector of probabilities to the quantile() function. For example, to calculate the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, you can use the following code:\n\nquantile(x, c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))\n\n 25%  50%  75% \n 4.0  5.0 10.5"

    "text": "Conclusion\n\nRecap of key points\n\nPercentiles are a way to rank data in a dataset.\nThe nth percentile is the value below which n% of the data falls.\nPercentiles can be calculated using a formula that involves the size of the dataset, the rank of the value, and the value itself.\nPercentiles are useful for comparing values within a dataset and understanding how they relate to one another.\nPercentiles can be used to identify trends and patterns in data, such as identifying outliers or identifying where most of the data lies.\nPercentiles can be represented visually using a box plot or other graphical representation.\nPercentiles can be used in many different fields, including statistics, finance, and healthcare.\n\n\n\nApplications of percentiles in real-world situations\n\nDetermining athletic performance levels: Percentiles can be used to compare an athlete’s performance to their peers or to a larger group. For example, a coach may use percentiles to determine if an athlete’s vertical jump score is in the top 10% or 25% of their age group or sport.\nAssessing health and fitness levels: Percentiles can be used to determine if an individual’s body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, or other health markers are within a healthy range. For example, a healthcare provider may use percentiles to determine if a patient’s BMI is in the normal range (between the 5th and 85th percentile) or if they are at risk for obesity (above the 85th percentile).\nEvaluating physical therapy progress: Physical therapists may use percentiles to track an individual’s progress over time. For example, if a patient’s balance scores are in the 30th percentile at the start of physical therapy and improve to the 75th percentile after several weeks of treatment, this can be considered a significant improvement.\nAnalyzing research results: Researchers may use percentiles to compare the results of their study to a larger population. For example, if a study found that the average running time for a group of athletes was in the 75th percentile compared to a larger population, this could suggest that the athletes were performing at a high level.\nSetting goals and targets: Percentiles can be used to set goals and targets for athletes or individuals looking to improve their health and fitness levels. For example, if a person’s BMI is in the 50th percentile, they may set a goal to improve to the 75th percentile to be considered in the “healthy” range.\n\n\n\nFurther resources for learning about percentiles\n\nOnline percentile calculator\nPercentiles on Scribbr\n\nIllustration by Ekaterina Rogova from Ouch!"

    "section": "Controversy",
    "text": "Controversy\nThere has been a growing controversy surrounding the use of p-values in scientific research, as some argue that they can be misused or misinterpreted, leading to erroneous conclusions.\nOne of the main criticisms of p-values is that they can be easily misused to “cherry pick” results that support a particular hypothesis, while ignoring results that do not. This can lead to a biased interpretation of the data and a distorted view of the underlying phenomenon being studied.\nAnother concern is that p-values are often used as a “cut-off” point, with results that have a p-value of less than 0.05 being considered statistically significant and worthy of publication, while those with a p-value greater than 0.05 are deemed not statistically significant and are often ignored. This can lead to a “publication bias,” where studies with statistically significant results are more likely to be published, while those with non-significant results are less likely to be published. This can lead to an inflated view of the reliability of certain findings, as the published literature may not accurately reflect the true state of the underlying phenomena being studied.\nThere have been a number of proposals for alternative approaches to p-values, including the use of confidence intervals, Bayesian statistics, and other methods. Some argue that these approaches are more robust and less prone to misuse than p-values. However, there is ongoing debate about the appropriateness of these alternatives and how they should be implemented in scientific research."

It’s actually okay if the predictors X and the outcome Y are non-normal, so long as the residuals are normal.\nLinearity. Assumes that the relationship between X and Y is linear (both simple regression or a multiple regression).\nHomogeneity of variance. The regression model assumes that each residual is comes from a normal distribution with mean 0, and with a standard deviation that is the same for every single residual. In practice, it’s impossible to test the assumption that every residual is identically distributed. Instead, what we care about is that the standard deviation of the residual is the same for all values of \\hat{Y}, and all values of every predictor Xi in the model.\nIndependence. The residuals are independent of one another.\n\nAlso, pay attention to the following:\nUncorrelated predictors. In a multiple regression model, you don’t want your predictors to be too strongly correlated with each other. Predictors that are too strongly correlated with each other (referred to as “collinearity”) can cause problems when evaluating the model.\nNo “bad” outliers. There is an implicit assumption that your regression model isn’t being too strongly influenced by one or two anomalous data points. This raises questions about the adequacy of the model and the trustworthiness of the data in some cases."

In other words, for each additional hour of sleep, Dani reduce her grumpiness level (points), which in turn will improve her mood.\nThe intercept: recall that the a is the predicted value of Yi when Xi is equal to 0.

This test is often used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the sample mean and the population mean.\nTo perform a one-sample t-test, you will need a sample of data and a hypothesis about the mean of the population. The null hypothesis for a one-sample t-test is that the sample mean is equal to the population mean. The alternative hypothesis is that the sample mean is not equal to the population mean.\nHere are the steps for running a one-sample t-test:\n\nCollect a sample of data. The sample should be representative of the population you are interested in.\nCalculate the mean of the sample.\nCalculate the standard deviation of the sample.\nCalculate the standard error of the mean (SEM). The SEM is a measure of the precision of the sample mean and is calculated as the standard deviation of the sample divided by the square root of the sample size.\nCalculate the t-value. The t-value is calculated by taking the difference between the sample mean and the population mean, and dividing it by the SEM.\nDetermine the degrees of freedom (df). The degrees of freedom is the number of observations in the sample minus one.\nLook up the t-value in a t-table or use a t-test calculator to find the p-value. The p-value is the probability that the difference between the sample mean and the population mean occurred by chance.\n\nTo interpret the results of a one-sample t-test, you will need to compare the p-value to a significance level, typically 0.05. If the p-value is less than the significance level, you can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the sample mean and the population mean. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, you cannot reject the null hypothesis and must conclude that there is not a significant difference between the sample mean and the population mean.\nIt is important to note that the one-sample t-test assumes that the sample is drawn from a normally distributed population. If the sample is not normally distributed, you may need to use a different statistical test.\nIn summary, a one-sample t-test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the mean of a sample and a known population mean. To perform a one-sample t-test, you will need a sample of data and a hypothesis about the mean of the population. You will then need to calculate the t-value and look up the p-value in a t-table or use a t-test calculator. The p-value can be compared to a significance level to determine whether the difference between the sample mean and the population mean is significant.\n\n# use pt() to find probability under the $t$-distribution\npt(-2.10, df = 18)\n\n[1] 0.0250452\n\n#&gt; [1] 0.025"

Each person is in one of several groups and we want to know whether these groups have different mean scores on some outcome variable.\nIn this lessons, I’ll discuss a broader class of experimental designs known as factorial designs, in which we have more than one independent variable (also known as Two-Way ANOVA).\nPreviously we were dealing with one single dependent variable and one single independent variable (2 or 3+ levels). But what if you have more than one IV/grouping variable? Factorial ANOVA is used in instances when there is more than one “factor” of interest; i.e., treatment & sex. The goal is to know the simultaneously effects of several FACTORS on the dependent variable. Thus, from now on, I will refer to it as F-ANOVA."

The idea behind the \\eta^2 is that, when measuring the effect size for a particular term (say, the main effect of Factor A), you want to deliberately ignore the other effects in the model (e.g., the main effect of Factor B).\nThat is, you would pretend that the effect of all these other terms is zero, and then calculate what the \\eta^2-value would have been. This is actually pretty easy to calculate. All you have to do is remove the sum of squares associated with the other terms from the denominator. In other words, if you want the partial η² for the main effect of Factor A, the denominator is just the sum of the SS values for Factor A and the residuals.[1]"

    "text": "Example\n\nData set\nYou can download either the jamovi template or the data set as csv for this example. Then proceed to open the file with jamovi. The data set comes from Weir and Vincent (2021)[2].\n\nIn this design, the researcher wanted to study the effect of 1 day, 3 days, or 5 days of practice per week (20 minutes per day) on the learning of a novel task of nondominant arm throwing accuracy (the dependent variable). In addition, the researcher wanted to know whether subjects with athletic experience (college-level varsity athletes) benefit differently from the various practice conditions than do college students with no experience in athletic competition.[2(p. 181)]\n\nBecause in the example above the researcher wants to test the effect of two independent variables (factors) on a single dependent variable and both factors are between-subjects, we need to use the Between-Between F-ANOVA. This is an example of 3 (practice conditions) x 2 (athletic experience) with equal number of participants in each group (balanced design).\n\nThree subjects in each group were then randomly assigned to one of the three practice conditions (1, 3, or 5 days of practice per week for 20 minutes per day). Number of days of practice was identified as factor B. Subjects’ scores on the throwing task at the end of 6 weeks were recorded as the dependent variable. The scores ranged from 1 to 10 (10 = high).[2(p. 181)]\n\nStep 1: Set up hypotheses and determine the level of significance\nAssume that Factor A refers to Experience and Factor B refers to Practice. Each of the H_0 below will be tested at alpha = 0.05.\nNull hypothesis\nFactor A\nH_0:\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 - There is no difference in the means of factor A\nFactor B\nH_0:\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 - There is no difference in the means of factor B\nInteraction\nH_0: There is no interaction between factors A and B\nAlternative hypothesis\nFactor A\nH_a:\\bar{x}_1 \\neq \\bar{x}_2 - The means are not equal\nFactor B\nH_a:\\bar{x}_1 \\neq \\bar{x}_2 \\neq \\bar{x}_3 - The means are not equal\nInteraction3\nH_a: There is an interaction between factors A and B\nStep 2: Select the appropriate test statistic\nBetween-Between F-ANOVA\n\ncomparing means\ntwo IVs and one DV\nthe IVs are independent groups (between-subjects)\n\nStep 3: Set the decision rule\nFactor A: Reject H_0 is p-value is less than 0.05\nFactor B: Reject H_0 is p-value is less than 0.05\nInteraction: Reject H_0 is p-value is less than 0.05\nStep 4: Compute the test statistic\nSet up\nIn jamovi, choose Analyses &gt; ANOVA &gt; ANOVA. Then, move Throwing Accuracy to the Dependent Variable box. Finally, move Experience and Practice to the Fixed Factors box.\nBecause we have more that one factor, we want to use the partial eta-squared (\\eta^2) as a measure of effect size. Simply check the box Partial \\eta^2 under Effect Size.\n\n\nFigure 1: Between-Between F-ANOVA test set up\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: F-ANOVA table\n\n\n\n\nChecking the assumptions\nBefore we interpret the ANOVA table (see Figure 2), we need to check if all assumptions have been met.\n\nIndependence. In their description of the study, the authors mentioned that participants were randomly assigned to different groups; this assumption has been met.\nOutliers: Create boxplots for each factor. In jamovi, choose Exploration &gt; Descriptive Statistics. Based on the boxplots below, there is no evidence of extreme outliers; thus, we will assume that this assumption has been met.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormality. Upon looking the results of the Shapiro-Wilk test, we conclude that this assumption has been met (p &gt; 0.05). However, others would argue the need to check normality for each combination of the groups of the two independent variables.\nHomogeneity of variance. There needs to be homogeneity of variances for each combination of the groups of the two independent variables. According to the Levene’s test, this assumption has been met (p &gt; 0.05).\n\n\nStep 5: Conclusion - make a decision to whether reject or retain the null hypotheses\n\nMain effect for Experience\nBy looking at the table above, and conclude that there is a Main Effect for factor A (Experience), F(12, 1) = 13.50, p = .003. This indicates that for all three levels of factor B combined, athletes scored significantly better than non-athletes (see Figure 3).\n\n\nFigure 3: Main effect for Experience\n\n\n\nMain effect for Practice\nThere was also a main effect for factor B (Practice), F(12, 2) = 30.29, p &lt; .001. This indicates that for both levels of A combined, a significant difference exists somewhere among the three levels of B. By looking at\n\n\nFigure 4: Main effect for Practice\n\n\n\nInteraction effect\nFinally, there was an interaction effect; F(12, 2) = 4.62, p = .032. This indicates that the effect of practice on throwing accuracy differ in athletes and non-athletes. Figure 5 below suggests that the effect of more days of practice on throwing accuracy is larger in the athletes than in the non-athletes. The significant F for the interaction tells us that the lines in Figure 5 are not statistically parallel.\nAlthough I present the results for both main effects above, arguably, “we must be cautious interpreting the main effects”[2(p. 184)]. This is because the Interaction Effect was significant. In fact, some would suggest[3] to skip the interpretation of the Main Effects if the Interaction effect is significant as it could be misleading.\nUse a step-down process to interpret the results. This means you should evaluate the main effects and interaction, and only proceed to further analysis (post hoc tests) if there is significance.\nA significant interaction tells us that the effects of factor A differs across levels of factor B (and vice-versa).\nThe significant F (F = 4.63, p = .03) for the interaction tells us that the effects of practice on throwing accuracy differ in athletes and nonathletes.\nWe could stop the interaction interpretation right here and simply note that the significant interaction indicates that athletes improve more with more practice than do non-athletes. However, we are often interested is delineating the specific mean differences in the cell means.\nWe can do this performing simple effects tests; see table below.\nSimple effects for A (Experience)\nF across A at B1 &gt; p = .730\nF across A at B2 &gt; p = .008\nF across A at B3 &gt; p = .004\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Interaction effect\n\n\n\nPost Hoc tests\nBecause Practice has more than two levels, we need to perform further analysis by running post hoc tests for the Factor Practice as well as for the Interaction.\nPost hoc tests for Practice\n\nEstimated Marginal Means"

When correlating one quantitative dependent variable (Yi) with multiple quantitative variables (Xi_1, Xi_2,...

For example, one can estimate percent body fat using the skinfold measurement technique. Although there are several techniques to estimate body fat, researchers have used the multiple regression technique to identify the best predictors. See excerpt below:\n\nThe practical equation including age, race, height, weight and waist circumference had high predictive ability for lean body mass (men: R 2=0·91, standard error of estimate (SEE)=2·6 kg; women: R 2=0·85, SEE=2·4 kg) and fat mass (men: R 2=0·90, SEE=2·6 kg; women: R 2=0·93, SEE=2·4 kg). Waist circumference was a strong predictor in men only. Addition of other circumference and skinfold measures slightly improved the prediction model. ref needed"

    "section": "Assumptions",
    "text": "Assumptions\nAdapted from Navarro and Foxcroft (2022)\n\nNormality. It assumes that the residuals are normally distributed. It’s actually okay if the predictors X and the outcome Y are non-normal, so long as the residuals are normal.\nLinearity. Assumes that the relationship between X and Y is linear (both simple regression or a multiple regression).\nHomogeneity of variance. The regression model assumes that each residual is comes from a normal distribution with mean 0, and with a standard deviation that is the same for every single residual. In practice, it’s impossible to test the assumption that every residual is identically distributed. Instead, what we care about is that the standard deviation of the residual is the same for all values of \\hat{Y}, and all values of every predictor Xi in the model.\nIndependence. The residuals are independent of one another.\n\nAlso, pay attention to the following:\nUncorrelated predictors. In a multiple regression model, you don’t want your predictors to be too strongly correlated with each other. Predictors that are too strongly correlated with each other (referred to as “collinearity”) can cause problems when evaluating the model.\nNo “bad” outliers. There is an implicit assumption that your regression model isn’t being too strongly influenced by one or two anomalous data points. This raises questions about the adequacy of the model and the trustworthiness of the data in some cases."

Notice that you may need to install the lsj-data module datalabcc (2018) in jamovi.\nBelow is the formula for a straight line when there are more than one independent (predictor) variable:\n\ny = a + b_1Xi1 + b_2Xi2 + b_jXi\n\nWhere, a is the intercept, b is the slope, and x is a given value. The intercept is where the line touches the y axis, which in the graph in the left is between 80 and 90. This is the expected value of Yi when Xi is equal to 0. The slop is the tilt of the best fit line.\nTo run the linear regression, click on Regression - Linear Regression analysis in jamovi, using the parenthood data set.\nThen specify dani.grump as the Dependent Variable, dani.sleep , and baby.sleep as the variables entered in the Covariates box.

In other words, for each additional hour of sleep, Dani reduce her grumpiness level (points), which in turn will improve her mood.\nThe intercept: recall that the a is the predicted value of Yi when Xi is equal to 0. Thus, if Dani gets zero hours of sleep (Xi = 0), then her grumpiness will reach about (Yi = 125.96), which is lot since the scale goes up to 100.\n\n\nAssumption Checks\nNormality: QQ-plots + Shapiro-Wilk test\nOutlier\nInterpretation: Values greater than 1 is often considered large and indicates the presence of outlier."

    "text": "Brief Bio\nOvande Furtado Jr., Ph.D.\nDr. Furtado received a B.A. in Physical Education from the Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, PR - Brazil. He earned his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Motor Behavior from the University of Pittsburgh, PA. Dr. Furtado’s line of research focuses on two main areas: (1) validation of observational models in psychomotor assessment instruments and (2) the relationship between motor skill competence, perceived motor competence, physical activity levels, and body composition.\nOffice Hours\nSee Section 1.5.5 for more information\nContact Info\nEmail: ovandef@csun.edu\nOffice: Redwood Hall 289\n\n\nThis course focuses on the introductory statistical techniques used in social science research. Students will be introduced to concepts such as reliability, validity, measures of central tendency, variability, probability, and statistical techniques including: t tests (independent & dependent samples), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Chi-square, correlation, and regression.\nStudents are expected to take the material/concepts presented in this course and apply them through a series of homework assignments and quizzes. The overall goal of the course is not only to help students understand the mathematical/statistical concepts presented but also to assist in the application of these procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI reserve the right to make changes to this syllabus at any point in the semester. I will inform you in class and via email and an updated syllabus will be posted on Canvas.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon completion of this course, you will be able to adequately:\n\nIntroduce statistical concepts utilized in research within the social sciences\nApply the mathematical/statistical techniques presented for social science research\nDemonstrate an ability to analyze and interpret data within the social sciences\nProvide practical examples as to when statistical techniques presented are appropriate methods for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeir and Vincent (2021)[1]\n\n\n\n\nStatKat - Statistical method selection table\nGPower - Statistical Power Analysis\n\nHHU website[2] (many resources related to the app, including tutorials)\nDemonstration Article[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\njamovi Statistical Software[4] (Free)\njamovi Video Tutorials1 (Free)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are responsible for the material covered in the textbook prior to attending each class. Note that the week’s readings are specified in the course sequence.\nIn addition to these readings, the instructor may assign supplemental readings throughout the semester. These supplemental readings do not appear on the schedule as these readings will be assigned at the instructor’s discretion.\nThe assignments used to enhance your learning experience in this course include:\n\n\nYou will be evaluated on your preparedness by submitting an assignment before each class (Major Takeaways).\n\n\n\nClass presence and participation points are given to encourage your active class participation and discussion. You will be rewarded with a perfect score as long as you frequently come to class and actively contribute to the class discussion during lectures.\nAlthough it is not required, most students send their professor a brief e-mail to explain their absence in advance.\n\n\n\nBefore each class, you will complete a multiple-choice quiz on the topic covered for that week. You will be given multiples attempts and the highest grade will be used.\n\n\n\nStudents will complete three (3) homework assignments on this course. The purpose of each assignment is to assist students in applying their understanding of the statistical procedures discussed in class as well as to provide an opportunity for students to respond to the readings.\nHomework assignments have two components. The first part is performing the statistical calculations correctly using jamovi. The second component involves interpreting the statistical analyses. When answering the interpretation questions, the point is to show that you know what your numbers mean, so don’t simply provide the definition of the term. For instance, if you calculate the “number needed to treat (NNT)” as NNT = 7.69, the interpretation of this number is something like “7.69 people must be given the treatment to prevent one adverse event. The wrong answer is something like”the NNT tells you how many people must be given the treatment to prevent one adverse event.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou are allowed to discuss homework with other students (and with the instructor), but you must write final answers yourself, in your own words. Solutions prepared “in committee” or by copying or paraphrasing someone else’s work are not acceptable; your hand-in assignments must represent your own thoughts (refer to [Academic Dishonesty Policy](#dishonesty) for more information); especially, the information about PLAGIARISM.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will be required to complete two (2) exams in this course. Students may use their notes and textbook for the exams, but no other outside resource other than a calculator can be used.\nEach exam have 10 questions, with each question worth 10 points. Exams must be completed in the allotted time. The focus of the exams (and quizzes) will be on concepts and interpretation, with most of the computational activities occurring in the homework assignments.\nAlthough the quizzes and exams will not focus on previously tested material (they are not meant to be cumulative), knowledge of previously tested material may be inherently required to answer questions related to new material.\nMost of the computational activities will be via the homework assignments. In addition, selected readings will be assigned through the semester. The content of these readings will be included on exam and quiz questions and in homework assignments.\n\n\n\n\nI will detail the policy for this course below.

I will round up from .5% and above, but anything below this will round down. In other words, 79.5 will round up to 80, while 79.4 will round down to 79 even.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRequests for an Incomplete (I) must conform to university policies. Among other requirements, “I” is possible only for instances in which you are demonstrating passing work in the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing up is 80 percent of life – Woody Allen, via Marshall Brickman\n\nAttendance will be taken at the beginning of every class; please, plan accordingly.\n\n\n\nWhile taking this course, only communicate with me via Canvas &gt; Inbox.\nIf your message concerns a non-private matter (i.e., assignments, content, deadlines, etc.), then please post your question to the Q&A Forum (Canvas &gt; Discussions &gt; Q&A Forum), which can be answered by any student taking the course.\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesdays from 9-11 am at RE 289.\n\n\n\nBy appointment only via https://calendly.com/drfurtado\n\n\n\n\nUnless you have made previous arrangements, a late assignments will be docked 10% per day (first 4 days) it is late. Students will not be allowed to submit assignments after the fourth day of the deadline.\n\n\n\nThere is no individual extra credit granted. Therefore, do not plan to make-up poor grades at the end of the semester by asking to do extra credit work. I might provide extra credit opportunities, but these will be offered to the entire class, not to individuals.\n\n\n\nFederal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level to qualified students with disabilities.\nThis instructor, in conjunction with California State University Northridge, is committed to upholding and maintaining all aspects of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\nIf you are a student with a disability and wish to request accommodations, please contact the office of Students with Disabilities Resources located in 110 Student Services Building, or call (818) 677-2684 for an appointment.

    "text": "You are responsible for the material covered in the textbook prior to attending each class. Note that the week’s readings are specified in the course sequence.\nIn addition to these readings, the instructor may assign supplemental readings throughout the semester. These supplemental readings do not appear on the schedule as these readings will be assigned at the instructor’s discretion.\nThe assignments used to enhance your learning experience in this course include:\n\n\nYou will be evaluated on your preparedness by submitting an assignment before each class (Major Takeaways).\n\n\n\nClass presence and participation points are given to encourage your active class participation and discussion. You will be rewarded with a perfect score as long as you frequently come to class and actively contribute to the class discussion during lectures.\nAlthough it is not required, most students send their professor a brief e-mail to explain their absence in advance.\n\n\n\nBefore each class, you will complete a multiple-choice quiz on the topic covered for that week. You will be given multiples attempts and the highest grade will be used.\n\n\n\nStudents will complete three (3) homework assignments on this course. The purpose of each assignment is to assist students in applying their understanding of the statistical procedures discussed in class as well as to provide an opportunity for students to respond to the readings.\nHomework assignments have two components. The first part is performing the statistical calculations correctly using jamovi. The second component involves interpreting the statistical analyses. When answering the interpretation questions, the point is to show that you know what your numbers mean, so don’t simply provide the definition of the term. For instance, if you calculate the “number needed to treat (NNT)” as NNT = 7.69, the interpretation of this number is something like “7.69 people must be given the treatment to prevent one adverse event. The wrong answer is something like”the NNT tells you how many people must be given the treatment to prevent one adverse event.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou are allowed to discuss homework with other students (and with the instructor), but you must write final answers yourself, in your own words. Solutions prepared “in committee” or by copying or paraphrasing someone else’s work are not acceptable; your hand-in assignments must represent your own thoughts (refer to [Academic Dishonesty Policy](#dishonesty) for more information); especially, the information about PLAGIARISM.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will be required to complete two (2) exams in this course. Students may use their notes and textbook for the exams, but no other outside resource other than a calculator can be used.\nEach exam have 10 questions, with each question worth 10 points. Exams must be completed in the allotted time. The focus of the exams (and quizzes) will be on concepts and interpretation, with most of the computational activities occurring in the homework assignments.\nAlthough the quizzes and exams will not focus on previously tested material (they are not meant to be cumulative), knowledge of previously tested material may be inherently required to answer questions related to new material.\nMost of the computational activities will be via the homework assignments. In addition, selected readings will be assigned through the semester. The content of these readings will be included on exam and quiz questions and in homework assignments."

I will round up from .5% and above, but anything below this will round down. In other words, 79.5 will round up to 80, while 79.4 will round down to 79 even.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRequests for an Incomplete (I) must conform to university policies. Among other requirements, “I” is possible only for instances in which you are demonstrating passing work in the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing up is 80 percent of life – Woody Allen, via Marshall Brickman\n\nAttendance will be taken at the beginning of every class; please, plan accordingly.\n\n\n\nWhile taking this course, only communicate with me via Canvas &gt; Inbox.\nIf your message concerns a non-private matter (i.e., assignments, content, deadlines, etc.), then please post your question to the Q&A Forum (Canvas &gt; Discussions &gt; Q&A Forum), which can be answered by any student taking the course.\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesdays from 9-11 am at RE 289.\n\n\n\nBy appointment only via https://calendly.com/drfurtado\n\n\n\n\nUnless you have made previous arrangements, a late assignments will be docked 10% per day (first 4 days) it is late. Students will not be allowed to submit assignments after the fourth day of the deadline.\n\n\n\nThere is no individual extra credit granted. Therefore, do not plan to make-up poor grades at the end of the semester by asking to do extra credit work. I might provide extra credit opportunities, but these will be offered to the entire class, not to individuals.\n\n\n\nFederal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level to qualified students with disabilities.\nThis instructor, in conjunction with California State University Northridge, is committed to upholding and maintaining all aspects of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\nIf you are a student with a disability and wish to request accommodations, please contact the office of Students with Disabilities Resources located in 110 Student Services Building, or call (818) 677-2684 for an appointment. Any information regarding your disability will remain confidential. Because many accommodations require early planning, requests for accommodations should be made as early as possible. Any requests for accommodations will be reviewed in a timely manner to determine their appropriateness to this setting.\n\n\n\nPlease, stop and read the information below; this is important!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nEach student is expected to be familiar with, and abide by, the conditions of student conduct, as presented in the CSUN Catalog, with emphasis on sections entitled, Student Conduct Code, Academic Dishonesty, Faculty Policy on Academic Dishonesty, and Penalties. Any student engaging in academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism) is subject to discipline, which may include a failing grade in the course, and may also be subject to more severe discipline by the University. Students are encouraged to visit the link below and become familiar with the Standards for Student Conduct.\nhttp://www.csun.edu/a&r/soc/studentconduct.html\n\n\n\n\nPlagiarism means using words, ideas, or arguments from another person or source without citation2. Cite all sources consulted to any extent (including material from the internet), whether or not assigned and whether or not quoted directly. For quotations, four or more words used in sequence must be set off in quotation marks, with the source identified.\nPlagiarism is a serious violation of the CSUN Student Conduct Code. Please read my comment about plagiarism under Homeworks. Any form of cheating will immediately earn you a failing grade for the entire course. By remaining enrolled, you consent to this policy.\n\nTurnitin (see below) will detect such misconducts as it checks every submission against a database of papers, as well as against the Internet.\n\nWhat is Turnitin?\nTurnitin is an automated system that instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student’s assignment with billions of websites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit assignments through the Canvas Assignment Tool in electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as an instructor, I receive a report from Turnitin that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment."

SLO 1, 2, 3 \nAnalyze current topics pertaining to human movement through a developmental lens. SLO 1, 3 \nApply different theoretical perspectives in explaining developmental change in human motor behavior. SLO 1, 2, 4 \nRecognize individual differences in physical growth by comparing and contrasting patterns of growth, and relate these patterns to physiological maturation. SLO 2 \nDiscuss the developmental periods when rapid change in body systems makes them particularly sensitive to external influences (e.g. deprivation, enrichment). SLO 1 \nSynthesize how the body systems interact at various times on the life span continuum. SLO 1 \nUse various methodologies and levels of analyses (e.g. product scores, growth measures, developmental sequences, or kinematics) to study motor development. SLO 1, 2\nDescribe various forms of motor behaviors at various points on the life span and the nature and relation of these behaviors. SLO 1, 4 \nCompare and contrast intra- and inter-task developmental sequences of motor skills. SLO 2, 4 \nInterpret an individual’s motor behavior as “more” or “less” advanced on a developmental continuum rather than as “good” or “bad.” SLO 4\nEmploy principles of motion and stability to analyze quality of motor skill performance. SLO 1, 2, 3, 4 \nCompare and contrast movement characteristics of various fundamental or functional movement skills across diverse populations, including various age groups, healthy individuals, and people with disabilities or special needs.

As the student progresses, the cognitive demand decreases, allowing them to perform the skill more automatically.\nControl of Movement: This criterion assesses the level of conscious and automatic control over the motor skill. In the initial learning stages, students rely heavily on conscious control. As they gain experience, the control of movement transitions to being more automatic, allowing for smoother execution.\nExecution Speed: This criterion evaluates the speed at which the student can perform the motor skill. Early in the learning process, students may perform the skill slowly and hesitantly. As they become more proficient, their execution speed increases, ultimately reaching an optimal or exceptional level.\nFluidity & Efficiency: This criterion measures the smoothness, consistency, and efficiency of the student’s movements.

As the student progresses, the cognitive demand decreases, allowing them to perform the skill more automatically.\nControl of Movement: This criterion assesses the level of conscious and automatic control over the motor skill. In the initial learning stages, students rely heavily on conscious control. As they gain experience, the movement control transitions to be more automatic, allowing smoother execution.\nFluidity & Efficiency: This criterion measures the smoothness, consistency, and efficiency of the student’s movements. In the beginning stages, students may struggle with fluidity and efficiency, but their movements become more reliable and efficient as they progress, eventually reaching a superior level.\nPrecision & Consistency: This criterion assesses the student’s ability to perform the motor skill accurately and consistently. Early learners often struggle with precision and consistency. Still, as they progress, they develop the ability to link these elements with their performance, ultimately achieving high accuracy and consistency.\nTime: Juggling: you must juggle 3 objects continuously for at least 5 seconds.

    "section": "The Three Stages of the Model:",
    "text": "The Three Stages of the Model:\n\nThe Cognitive Stage:\nThe first stage of the model is known as the cognitive stage. In this stage, individuals learn the basic elements of the task and understand the rules and strategies required to perform it. This stage is characterized by focusing on the conscious processing of information and is heavily influenced by cognitive processes such as attention and memory. As a result, individuals are highly reliant on explicit instructions and feedback to guide their performance, and movements often need to be faster and more coordinated.\nDuring the cognitive stage, individuals must understand the task requirements and the strategies for performing it. This requires attention to be directed toward the task, and individuals must process information about the task and its requirements. As a result, their movements are often slow and uncoordinated, reflecting the need for conscious control and attention. Moreover, individuals at this stage rely highly on explicit instructions and feedback to guide their performance, as they have yet to develop a more automatic understanding of the task.\n\n\nThe Associative Stage:\nThe second stage of the model is known as the associative stage. During this stage, individuals begin to incorporate implicit learning processes, such as trial and error, into their performance. Movements become smoother and more consistent, and individuals can perform the task with greater accuracy and speed. However, their performance is still not fully automatic, and they may still require conscious thought and effort to perform the task.\nAt this stage, individuals are beginning to develop a deeper understanding of the task and its requirements. This deeper understanding allows them to use trial and error to improve their performance, as they formance, as they can incorporate implicit learning processes. As a result, movements become smoother and more consistent, and performance improves in terms of accuracy and speed. However, performance is still not fully automatic, and individuals may still require conscious thought and effort to perform the task.\n\n\nThe Autonomous Stage:\nThe third and final stage of the model is the autonomous stage. In this stage, individuals have developed a high level of expertise in the task and are able to perform it automatically and effortlessly. The task has become so well-learned that it is no longer necessary to consciously think about how to perform it, and individuals can focus their attention on other aspects of the task. Movement is smooth, accurate, and consistent, and performance is largely unaffected by attentional demands or distractions. At the autonomous stage, individuals have developed a high level of expertise in the task and are able to perform it with ease. The task has become automatic, and individuals no longer need to consciously think about how to perform it. Instead, they are able to perform the task effortlessly, with smooth, accurate, and consistent movements. Performance is largely unaffected by attentional demands or distractions, as the task has become so well-learned that it can be performed automatically."

It provides a clear understanding of how individuals progress from novice to expert in a particular task and is widely applied in a variety of fields, including sports psychology, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction. By recognizing the different stages of skill acquisition, practitioners in these fields are able to develop more effective training programs and interventions. For example, in sports psychology, understanding the three stages of the model can help coaches to design training programs that are tailored to the needs of athletes at different stages of development. Similarly, in rehabilitation, the model can be used to guide the development of therapy programs that help individuals to regain motor skills after injury or illness. Ultimately, the Fitts and Posner three-stage model continues to be an important tool for understanding the complex process of motor skill acquisition and for improving the development of skills in a variety of contexts."

    "text": "Problem Scenarios\n\nField of Physical Therapy\nA 32-year-old patient named John has recently suffered a stroke and has lost the ability to use his right arm. He has been referred to a physical therapist to help him regain the use of his arm. John’s therapist has determined that he is currently at the cognitive stage of the Fitts and Posner three-stage model of motor learning.\nThe therapist’s goal is to help John progress through the stages of the model and ultimately reach the autonomous stage, where he can perform movements with his right arm effortlessly and with a high level of accuracy. However, John is struggling with the cognitive stage, and his movements are slow and uncoordinated. He is heavily reliant on explicit instructions and feedback from his therapist to guide his performance, and he is unable to perform the task without conscious thought and effort.\nThe therapist recognizes that John needs to progress through the associative stage, where he can incorporate implicit learning processes into his performance, before he can reach the autonomous stage. The therapist needs to develop a therapy program that will help John to move through the associative stage and ultimately reach the autonomous stage. The therapy program should be designed to improve John’s accuracy and speed of movement, while also reducing his reliance on explicit instructions and feedback. The program should also be designed to help John to develop a deeper understanding of the task and the requirements for performing it, so that he can incorporate implicit learning processes into his performance.\nIn order to achieve these goals, the therapist will need to employ a range of techniques and strategies, including repetition, feedback, and the use of visualization and mental rehearsal. The therapist will also need to closely monitor John’s progress and adjust the therapy program as needed to ensure that he is able to progress through the stages of the model and ultimately reach the autonomous stage. By successfully navigating the Fitts and Posner three-stage model, John’s therapist can help him to regain the use of his arm and achieve a high level of functional independence.\n\n\nField of Physical Education\nA physical education teacher named Mrs. Smith has a class of 10-year-old students who are learning gymnastics. The students have a wide range of abilities, with some students being relatively inexperienced and others having prior gymnastics experience. Mrs. Smith has determined that the majority of her students are currently at the cognitive stage of the Fitts and Posner three-stage model of motor learning.\nMrs. Smith’s goal is to help her students progress through the stages of the model and ultimately reach the autonomous stage, where they can perform gymnastics movements effortlessly and with a high level of accuracy. However, many of her students are struggling with the cognitive stage and are heavily reliant on explicit instructions and feedback from Mrs. Smith to guide their performance. The students’ movements are slow and uncoordinated, and they are unable to perform the movements without conscious thought and effort.\nMrs. Smith recognizes that her students need to progress through the associative stage, where they can incorporate implicit learning processes into their performance, before they can reach the autonomous stage. Mrs. Smith needs to develop a gymnastics program that will help her students to move through the associative stage and ultimately reach the autonomous stage. The gymnastics program should be designed to improve the students’ accuracy and speed of movement, while also reducing their reliance on explicit instructions and feedback. The program should also be designed to help the students develop a deeper understanding of the movements and the requirements for performing them, so that they can incorporate implicit learning processes into their performance.\nIn order to achieve these goals, Mrs. Smith will need to employ a range of techniques and strategies, including repetition, feedback, and the use of visualization and mental rehearsal. Mrs. Smith will also need to closely monitor the students’ progress and adjust the gymnastics program as needed to ensure that they are able to progress through the stages of the model and ultimately reach the autonomous stage. By successfully navigating the Fitts and Posner three-stage model, Mrs. Smith can help her students to develop the skills and confidence needed to excel in gymnastics and achieve a high level of functional ability."

In the early stages of learning, a significant amount of cognitive activity is needed to understand and execute the skill. As the student progresses, the cognitive demand decreases, allowing them to perform the skill more automatically.\nControl of Movement: This criterion assesses the level of conscious and automatic control over the motor skill. In the initial learning stages, students rely heavily on conscious control. As they gain experience, the movement control transitions to be more automatic, allowing smoother execution.\nFluidity & Efficiency: This criterion measures the smoothness, consistency, and efficiency of the student’s movements. In the beginning stages, students may struggle with fluidity and efficiency, but their movements become more reliable and efficient as they progress, eventually reaching a superior level.\nPrecision & Consistency: This criterion assesses the student’s ability to perform the motor skill accurately and consistently. Early learners often struggle with precision and consistency. Still, as they progress, they develop the ability to link these elements with their performance, ultimately achieving high accuracy and consistency.\nTime: Juggling: you must juggle 3 objects continuously for at least 5 seconds.

This becomes a problem if large objects are being used; i.e., tennis balls.\n\n\n\n\nSpeed Stacks Sport Stacking Set\nIf you choose to learn the cup stacking, I recommend you to acquire the cups used in national and international tournaments, or grab a set of less expensive ones from Amazon or elsewhere.\n\nDO NOT USE ORDINARY PLASTIC CUPS WHEN PRACTICING AS THEY ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR CUP STACKING. These cups will significantly affect your performance and your grade, in case you choose cup stacking as your learning task."

Any student engaging in academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism) is subject to discipline, which may include a failing grade in the course, and may also be subject to more severe discipline by the University. Students are encouraged to visit the link below and become familiar with the Standards for Student Conduct.\nhttp://www.csun.edu/a&r/soc/studentconduct.html\n\nReflection Paper Submission\nPlagiarism is a serious violation of the CSUN Student Conduct Code. Be aware that borrowing a paper from a student who completed this course previously and writing your paper based on that student’s paper will be considered PLAGIARISM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTurnitin (see below) will detect such misconducts as it checks every submission against a database of papers, as well as against the Internet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nPenalties: If caught, the student will receive a letter grade of “F” on BOTH the Reflection Paper and the Video Performance assignments, in which case the student will likely fail the course as these two assignments account for 40% of the course total grade.\n\n\nWhat is Turnitin?\nYou should be aware that the Reflection Paper will be submitted via Canvas, which is connected to Turnitin. This is an automated system that instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student’s assignment with billions of websites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit assignments through the Canvas Assignment Tool in electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as an instructor, I receive a report from Turnitin that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment."

A community is a group of individuals who work together to support a common goal or interest. We are working together to support the successful achievement of our learning outcomes.\nLog-in and participate regularly to group conversations and activities.\nTreat the diverse contributions made by other community members with respect.\nHave patience and a sense of humor with technology.\nBe a learner. Keep an open mind when introduced to new ideas that may challenge your perceptions.\nAsk for help when you need it, and assist others when possible.\nUnderstand that communications shared through text have a higher likelihood of being misinterpreted than words that are spoken. Therefore, when you type a thought or a comment, read it carefully before you submit it. If you question the way it is worded, read it out loud to yourself. If you still question the way it’s phrased, rewrite it.\nContribute regularly to group dialogue, including discussion posts and replies. The contributions of each individual plays a role in the collective strength and diversity of our community.\nIf, at any time, you feel that any of these ground rules has been violated by a member of our community, you are encouraged to bring your concern directly and immediately to Dr. Furtado. Clearly identify which ground rule has been violated and include specific evidence of the violation in your e-mail or phone call. Your concerns will be addressed promptly and in an individualized manner."

If you select juggling, I suggest you to acquire the mini juggling balls, which are small and have the recommended weight for beginners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you choose to use any object other than the mini juggling balls, understand that your performance may be negatively affected by it. When performing the exchange technique (required for this activity), at a given point, performers need to hold two objects in one hand. This becomes a problem if large objects are being used; i.e., tennis balls.\n\n\n\n\nSpeed Stacks Sport Stacking Set\nIf you choose to learn the cup stacking, I recommend you to acquire the cups used in national and international tournaments, or grab a set of less expensive ones from Amazon or elsewhere.\n\nDO NOT USE ORDINARY PLASTIC CUPS WHEN PRACTICING AS THEY ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR CUP STACKING. These cups will significantly affect your performance and your grade, in case you choose cup stacking as your learning task."

    "section": "Appendix A",
    "text": "Appendix A\nOne of the major requirements of this course is to learn how to perform a motor skill (either Hand Juggling or Speed Cup Stacking). You will be required to practice, learn, and show proof of mastery for the selected skill by video recording your performance.\nIn addition to learning the skill of your preference, you will be required to write a reflection paper discussing your experience.\nNOTE: If you have mastered Hand Juggling and Speed Cup Stacking, contact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss alternative skills you may select to practice. Note that you may be asked to prove you have mastered both skills before you are assigned a new skill.\n\nThe choice of skill\nYou will be given the option to choose the skill to practice and learn.\nYou will learn in this course that Juggling and Cup Speed Stacking are placed under two different categories as far as motor learning is concerned. Each skill has different cognitive and motor skill demands. Juggling is categorized as a continuous skill. Continuous skills have not detectable beginning and end once the performer has started performing it. Cup Speed Stacking on the other hand is considered a discrete skill, which has a clear beginning and end. One begins by stacking up the first “three” on the left/right and ends by stacking down the opposite “three” (left/right).\nMy suggestion:\n\nWatch the demo videos below for both skills;\nPick the one that is most appealing to you;\nComplete the tutorial for the chosen skill (Appendix B);\nAcquire the proper equipment and start practicing as per the recommendations outlined in this course;\nWhen released, complete the update assignments (1, and 2);\nIf after completing the Update 2 assignment you feel the chosen skill is not for you, contact the instructor ASAP to receive permission to switch skills.\n\n\n\nHand Juggling 3 objects continuously\nHand juggling requires lots of practice, and the amount of time needed to master this motor skill will depend on a number of factors. Dedication, focus, discipline, along with the use of motor learning strategies (Motor Learning Principles) are just some of these factors.\nSome have claimed (and demonstrated) that juggling can be learned in 24 hours, or even 10 minutes.\nFor this assignment, you will be given plenty of time to learn the skill (up to 4 months if taking this course in the fall or spring).\n\nJuggling Requirements\nIf you select the skill of hand juggling to practice and learn, you will be required to:\n\nJuggle 3 objects continuously for at least 5 seconds to receive the full points under the evaluation category of TIME (refer to the evaluation rubric for this assignment). \nYou can earn 5 extra points if you continuously juggle 3 objects for at least 10 seconds (using the correct technique). \n\n\n\nThe technique\nThe “exchange continuous” technique is the only technique that will be accepted if you select the skill of juggling 3 objects. Watch the video below to have a sense of what this technique looks like.\nKIN 377 Keith Makiuchi Juggling\n\nIncorrect techniques that will NOT be accepted\nBelow are some examples of techniques that you should NOT use. Although it is possible to “juggle” using different techniques, the alternative techniques discussed below WILL NOT be accepted. If you are unsure, contact Dr. Furtado to verify if the technique you are practicing will be accepted.\n\n\n\nJuggling with a pause\nJuggling in circling motion\n\n\n\n\nSome might use this technique during the early stages of skill learning, as a practice technique. However, the videos recorded for the learning updates and the final submission should not depict this technique.\nAgain, some might use this technique during the early stages of skill learning, as a practice technique. However, the videos recorded for the learning updates and the final submission should not depict this technique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you start practicing Juggling\n\nChoose 3 objects to use when practicing this skill.\nThe only exception is that you cannot use scarves, plastic bags, or anything light that makes the “exchange” process easier. As you will see in the tutorial, scarves or plastic bags are used at the beginning of the learning process when learners need more time to think during the exchange. This is a learning technique that may be used to learn this skill, but you should NOT submit the final video (or the updates) juggling scarves or plastic bags.  \nAlthough not required, I encourage you to purchase a set of 3 mini juggling balls if you choose this skill. Amazon sells a set of 3 for about $6. Here is the link → http://goo.gl/5VHs9d\nI’ve put together a tutorial (APPENDIX B) that is meant to help you before and after you start practicing.\n\n\n\nThings to consider when practicing Juggling\n\nPractice a few hours per day. Learning a motor skill takes time and practice. Waiting until the end of the term to begin practicing is a really bad idea.\nAs you practice the skill, use the Motor Learning Principles (APPENDIX C) that will be taught in this course. For example, jugglers use the Principle of Simplification when learning to juggle 3 objects:\nThey begin by tossing a single object up with one hand and catching with the opposite hand. Then, they proceed by using 2 objects, and then 3 objects. There are many other Motor Learning Principles that can be used when learning the skill of juggling. Note that this technique SHOULD NOT be used when recording the Update or Final video performance; this technique should only be used for training purposes. \nTo earn the full points for TIME, student must juggle continuously for 5 seconds or more. The full evaluation criteria will be released soon.\n\n\n\n\nSpeed Cup Stacking\nIf you select the skill of cup stacking to practice and learn, you will be required to perform the technique called 3-6-3 (watch the video below) and finish the “up & down” at or under 10 seconds to receive full points. You can earn some extra points (up to 5 points) if you complete the 3-6-3 “up & down” at or under 5:00 seconds.\nVisit the link below for an example that depicts the technique you will be required to learn if you choose this skill:\nhttps://youtu.be/OjEH3ugV6mM\n\nBefore you start practicing Cup Stacking\n\nPurchase a set of 12 professional cups online or from a local toy store. Amazon sells a set of 12 cups for about $10 → https://goo.gl/q1kKiw\nI’ve put together a tutorial that is meant to help you before and after you start practicing: click here to access the tutorial\n\n\n\nThings to consider when practicing Cup Stacking\n\nIt is imperative that you practice a few hours per day. Learning a motor skill takes time and practice. Waiting until the end of the term to begin practicing is a really bad idea.\nAs you practice the skill, use the Motor Learning Principles that will be taught in this course. For example, learners can employ the concept of “Whole Practice vs Part Practice” when learning the skill. Instead of trying to learn the 3-6-3 (Whole Practice), one can learn the “3” and the “6” steps separately (Part Practice).\n\n\n\n\nVideo Recording for Juggling or Cup Stacking\nYou must video record yourself while performing the chosen skill. Although students are free to choose the device of their choice, using a tablet, smartphone or even a laptop\n\nA few things to consider:\n\nPick a place with decent lighting\nChoose your device; it could be your cell phone, a tablet, or even a computer \nPractice several trials while the camera is off\nWhen ready, record a sequence of THREE trials with intervals of 3 seconds in between trials.\nHere is the sequence:\n\nTurn on the camera\nPosition yourself in front of the camera (ensure your face appears on camera)\n\nWait 3 seconds ⟶ TRIAL 1 \nWait 3 seconds ⟶ TRIAL 2\nWait 3 seconds ⟶ TRIAL 3\n\nTurn off the camera; you are done!\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant notes\n\nThe recording must be done continuously. Do not pause the video, especially in between trials; nor should the recorded sequence be edited in ANY FORM - IF YOU DO, THE VIDEO WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU.\nAny submission containing a video that does not conform to the requirements of the items above will be returned to the student. Note that the “late assignment” policy will be applied in such a case (refer to our Syllabus for more info). \nThough not required, it is recommended that you ask someone to video record you as that person can move and follow you in case you move around during the performance;\nIf you juggle the object for 10 seconds (any of the 3 attempts), you may stop at 10 seconds since this is the minimum required to earn the extra points (refer to the Grading Rubrics);\nYou MUST record 3 attempts, even if you got 10 seconds on the first and/or the second attempt;\n\nI will consider your best attempt for grading purposes, not the average of the 3 attempts.\n\nDO NOT record more than 3 attempts. If you recorded 3 trials and for some reason, you are not happy with the result, you will have to start all over. ONLY submit a video that has 3 attempts.\nYou must provide the time it took you to complete each attempt. ONCE THE FINAL VIDEO IS RECORDED, WATCH IT AND USE A TIMER (CELL PHONE) TO TIME EACH ATTEMPT. WRITE IT DOWN SINCE YOU WILL NEED TO SUBMIT THE TIME IT TOOK YOU TO COMPLETE EACH ATTEMPT WITH THE VIDEO. YOU WILL DO IT BY ADDING ADDING A COMMENT TO THE SUBMITTED VIDEO. For instance:\n\nAttempt 1 →  4:34 (4 seconds and 34 milliseconds)\nAttempt 2 →  2:24 (2 seconds and 24 milliseconds)\nAttempt 3 →  1:11 (1 second and 11 milliseconds)\n\nNote that you should NOT add up the time of each attempt so that:\n\n4:34\n6:58 (4:34+2:24)\n7:69 (4:34+2:24+1:11)\n\n\n\n\nVideo Submission (Juggling or Cup Stacking)\nFollow the steps below to submit the video you recorded to fulfill the requirements of either the Update 2 or Final Video Performance assignment for the chosen skill (Juggling or Cup Stacking).\n\nRecord the video for the assignment in question (Update 2 or Final Video Performance)\nUsing a computer or tablet, open Canvas and locate the assignment in question\nClick on Start Assignment\nAttach your video to the submission and submit the assignment\n\n\n\n6. Learning Task Updates\nYou will be submitting several updates throughout the semester (a 6-week period for summer sessions). Below you will find some key information regarding these updates. To avoid surprises, be proactive, and review these assignments.\n\nUpdate 1: Cognitive stage\n\nFirst, read Chapter 12 (The Stages of Learning)\nAs you are reading, pay close attention to the characteristics associated with the first stage of learning as described by Fitts and Posner (Cognitive Stage).\nNext, select the skill you will be practicing and learning as part of the Learning Task Assignment. \nPractice the skill for 1 or 2 days (a few hours each day). You will be asked to describe how your experience reflects (or does not) Fitts & Posner description of the Cognitive Stage. Please, be specific. \n\n\n\nUpdate 2: Video update\nYou will be required to record and submit a video for UPDATE 2. The video you will be submitting must depict you performing the skill you have selected for the Learning Task Assignment. It should be apparent in the video that you have moved from the Fitts & Posner Cognitive Stage to the Associative Stage (refer to Chapter 12 for more info).\nYou must follow the instructions outlined above for video recording (Juggling and Cup Stacking) and video submission(both skills).\n\n\nUpdate 3: Principles of Motor Learning*\n*Does not apply to students taking this course during the winter.\nThis is the last update before you submit your video performance at the end of the semester (6-week period for summer sessions). You will be required to do the following:\n\nPick TWO of the Principles of Motor Learning you have been using to learn your selected motor skill (juggling or speed cut stacking).\nFor EACH, provide the following:\nThe principle’s name and definition (make sure to cite our textbook properly)\nA description of how the principle is helping you to progress through the Fitts & Posner Stages of Learning (BE SPECIFIC)\nThe hurdles you have faced when trying to employ the principle as a learning strategy (BE SPECIFIC)\n\n\n\n\nReflection Paper\nReflection Paper Template\n\nInstructions\nIn addition to performing the chosen task, you will be required to write a reflection piece describing your learning experience. You must include at least 3 Motor Learning Principles (MLP) as part of your reflection in addition to discuss the three stages of learning from Fitts and Posner (refer to Chapter 12 on our textbook). Read Appendix C for further information regarding the MLPs.\n\n\nFor the skill selected, do the following:\n\nWrite a 6-page (double-spaced) reflection paper describing your experience. As part of your reflection, you need to:\n\ndiscuss how you moved through the stages of learning (described by Fitts and Posner - Chapter 12)\ndiscuss 3 Motor Learning Principles (e.g., feedback, practice distribution, etc.) covered in this course and explain how the principles were applied to your learning experience.\n\n\n\n\nYour reflection paper must:\n\nhave a minimum of 6 FULL pages and no more than 10 pages;\nbe typed using 12-point Times New Roman font, no exceptions;\nbe typed in double space, no exceptions;\n\nNO EXTRA SPACE IN BETWEEN PARAGRAPHS AND EACH SECTION OF YOUR PAPER\n\nhave 1-inch margins on all sides\nhave a “Works Cited” page (does not count toward the 6-page minimum)\n\nShould be on a separate page.

Your paper will be returned if any of the three principles you selected is not in the list below.\nThe “stages of learning” principle, DOES NOT count as one of the three principles you will be selecting. The stages of the learning principle will be a separate section of your paper. Thus, you will be discussing 4 principles as part of your paper. The “stages of learning” (cognitive, associative, autonomous) + the 3 other principles coming from the list below.\nTake some time to study this Quizlet set to improve your knowledge of MLPs.\n\n\n\nMotor Learning Principles (MLP) you should consider when practicing the chosen skill:\n\n[CH07] speed-accuracy trade-off principle\n\nA characteristic of motor skill performance in which the speed at which a skill is performed is influenced by movement accuracy demands. The trade-off is that increasing speed yields decreasing accuracy, and vice versa.\n\n[CH09] Action-effect principle (hypothesis) - internal vs external focus\n\nThe proposition that actions are best planned and controlled by their intended effects. When related to attention focus, this hypothesis proposes that the learning and performance of skills are optimized when the performer’s attention is directed to the intended outcome of the action rather than on the movements themselves.\n\n[CH11] Encoding specificity principle\n\nA memory principle that indicates the close relationship between encoding and retrieval memory processes. It states that memory test performance is directly related to the amount of similarity between the practice and the test contexts; i.e., the more similarity, the better the test performance will be.\n\n[CH13] Transfer of learning principle - positive or negative\n\nThe influence of prior learning on the learning of a new skill or the performance of a skill in a new context.\n\n[CH14] Augmented feedback principle - concurrent, terminal, etc.\n\nA generic term used to describe information about a performance that supplements the sensory feedback and comes from a source external to the performer; it is sometimes referred to as extrinsic or external feedback.\n\n[CH14] Cognitive mediation theory (principle)\n\nA theory for explaining the benefit of a demonstration proposing that when a person observes a skilled model, the person translates the observed movement information into a cognitive code that the person stores in memory and uses when the observer performs the skill.\n\n[CH16] Practice variability principle - random vs blocked practice\n\nThe memory and performance disruption (i.e., interference) that results from performing multiple skills or variations of a skill within the context of practice.\n\n[CH17] Distribution of practice principle - Distributed vs Massed\n\nDistributed is a practice schedule in which the amount of rest between practice sessions or trials is relatively long. Massed is a practice schedule in which the amount of rest between practice sessions or trials is very short.\n\n[CH17] Overlearning\n\nA practice that continues beyond the amount needed to achieve a certain performance criterion.\n\n[CH18] Whole vs part practice principle (more info here)\n\nSkills that are high in organization and low in complexity are best served through whole practice. The part practice method generally involves breaking down the skill into natural parts or segments, practicing those parts separately until they are learned, and then integrating them to perform the skill in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, you will find the paper written by Dr. Denny in which she discusses the application of several MLPs in coaching volleyball. YOU MUST READ THE ARTICLE BELOW AND COMPLETE THE ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE ARTICLE - LT Update 3\n\nFollowing each principle, I provide my own comments.

(2010). Applying motor learning principles in coaching volleyball. Coaching Volleyball Magazine, (June/July), 24–25.\nCoaching volleyball is enhanced when coaches draw from a variety of disciplines to assist in teaching skill development. The discipline of motor learning focuses on the acquisition of motor skills and/or the improvement of motor skills and involves principles that can be implemented by coaches to aid in volleyball skill acquisition. Coaches using principles from motor learning literature will enable players to reach their full potential in learning and developing volleyball skills leading to a more effective performance on the court. The following is a two-part series, summarizing various principles from motor learning research and making applications for coaching the sport of volleyball.\n\nPrinciple #1: Encoding specificity principle (The Practice Conditions Should Be Like the Game)\nIt has been stated that if you want to learn how to play the game, then play the game. In motor learning, this is a memory principle called the “encoding specificity principle” which suggests that the more closely aligned the practice context is to the game context, the better the game performance. For volleyball coaches, this means striving to make the practice conditions as much like the game conditions as possible. For example, if you know you will be playing in a gym with a very low ceiling, practice passing balls at a lower level. If you are going to face a big middle hitter who cuts the angles in your next match, then have someone hitting those angles in practice. If you want your players to perform well during stressful games, set up similar pressure situations during practice. For example, playing loud music, making bad calls, or putting the server on the end-line to serve for game point after a long rally, are all examples of making practice more like the game. Practices would include everything and anything that could possibly be experienced during the game. As a coach, look for ways to guarantee players have already practiced everything before they actually see it in the real game, and always be analyzing practices by evaluating how well you are training your players for actual game performance.\nMy own comments:\nThe practice conditions should approximate as much as possible the test conditions. In practicing the chosen skill, consider this principle. Because you will be required to video record yourself, it is important you video record yourself a couple of times while practicing. Performers tend to get nervous when they find out they have to perform in front of other people and/or in front of the camera.\nIn addition, it is essential you are consistent when it comes to equipment and location. You must choose the equipment that will be used during practice asap.\nIf juggling is your choice, then you must decide whether to use bean bags, balls, or any other object. I strongly advise you to choose the small bean bags you can find in local toy stores or Amazon (https://goo.gl/yvaWU5).\nIf speed cup stacking is your choice, you must decide which kind of cups you will use for practice. Last time I checked, this set of cups (https://goo.gl/QrJZU9) was less than $5 on Amazon. Do NOT choose regular plastic cups as they will negatively affect your performance.\n\n\nPrinciple #2: Practice variability principle - The Practice Conditions Should Provide for Variability (blocked vs random)\nA second motor learning principle that is closely related to the encoding principle is called the “contextual interference principle” which stresses that random types of practice conditions are usually best. For example, if you are working on passing, it is best not to just practice passing from the same spot over and over again. This is called block practice and is not at all like the game of volleyball. How often does the player stand in one spot passing ten balls in a row from the same server from the same area? In random practice, the player might be asked to serve-receive 10 different types of serves from 10 different places from several different types of servers on the court. This random practice schedule best prepares passers to receive in the game. A further application would be after serve-receive, have players practice coming in for different types of sets and hits along the net with a full team coverage formation. Random practice has been proven to be effective in most situations. The only time random practice is discouraged is with beginners. For beginning players, coaches should start with a block schedule, practicing the same skill in the same way under the same condition repeatedly. The problem with most coaches, however, is that they continue this blocked practice schedule long after the athlete has acquired the basic skill pattern. Once the basic skill is demonstrated, random practice should be introduced.\nMy own comments:\nRandom practice variability is more useful when learning “open skills”. Both juggling and speed cup stacking areconsidered “closed skills”, and, therefore, requires blocked practice. With open skills, the environmental features determine when to begin the action. In basketball, for instance, when dribbling the ball toward the basket while opponents are trying to steal the ball. This is an example of “open skill” since the features of the environment are not predictable. On the other hand, the free-throw shooting in basketball is considered a “closed skill”. The features of the environment are predictable and the player decides when to initiate the action.\n\n\nPrinciple #3: Learning Occurs in Three Distinct Stages\nMotor learning is complex and consists of three distinct stages. The cognitive stage is when the learner creates a mental picture of the skill to be executed along with processing the visual, kinesthetic, and auditory cues needed for the skill. Performance during this initial stage is full of questions and errors as the learner attempts to get an idea of how to do the skill. During the second stage, called the associative stage, the learner begins to understand how to do the skill and “associates” the movement with environmental cues. This stage is sometimes called the refining stage since learners begin to narrow the motor response and identify and correct errors on their own. The final stage of motor learning is termed the autonomous stage since the performance of the skill is now automatic. At this stage the learned skill is now a habit, requiring little attention. In order to reach this highest level, many years of practice are needed, and not all performers will achieve this final stage. For coaches, it is important to identify which stage a player is present since different stages require different coaching skills. During the initial cognitive stage, appropriate and timely feedback is needed to help the novice performer understand how to do the skill and how to correct errors. The coach is providing lots of encouragement along with appropriate feedback during the cognitive stage. During the associative stage, the coach’s role shifts towards refining techniques. During this stage, the coach waits and allows the player to identify his or her own performance errors and correction. While the emphasis is on refinement, there are ample opportunities for practice to develop the consistency of the skill performance. Working with athletes in the final autonomous stage, the role of the coach again is different. Now the emphasis is on developing strategies and tactics for using the skill in a variety of game situations.\nMy own comments:\nNote that I do not consider the stages of learning as a motor learning principle per se. I treat the stages of learning as a separate section of the Reflection Paper (please refer to this assignment for more information).\n\n\nPrinciple #4: Transfer of learning principle (Consider Transfer of Learning When Teaching New Motor Skills)\nTransfer of learning is the effect previous experiences have on the learning of a new skill or performing a skill in a new context. The concept of transfer lays the foundation for all of skill learning. Transfer of learning can be positive, negative, or neutral. Volleyball coaches should be aware of the transfer of learning effect and utilize it to help with teaching new skills to players or teaching already learned skills in new contexts. Positive transfer provides the foundation for teaching skill progression. Once a skill is learned, it can be transferred to new settings, or be the foundation for new skill learning. An example of transfer would be the overhand throwing pattern. Early in a child’s development, the correct overhand pattern should be established. This skill can then be applied across different settings and into new sport skills. In volleyball the spike and jump serve both derive from the basic overhand pattern. Ensure that this fundamental skill is acquired at an early age so that positive transfer can occur later in volleyball skill learning. While positive transfer is a powerful tool, coaches should be aware of the role that negative transfer can play as well. Although negative transfer is temporary, it does initially hinder or hurt learning a new skill. In volleyball, an example of this could be when players initially learn to jump off two feet when spiking, and then the coach tries to teach the basic one-foot take-off for the slide. Since negative transfer is not permanent, the coach should be patient as players work on learning similar, but different skills.\nMy own comments:\nWhen practicing your chosen skill reflect upon previous experience acquired when practicing a similar skill. When doing so, consider whether there was a positive or negative transfer of learning when learning juggling or speed cup stacking. If so, you may discuss how such an experience affected the learning process of your chosen skill. Make sure to provide details.\n\n\nPrinciple #5: Action-effect principle (Focus Attention on the Movement Effects Rather Than Just the Movement)\nTraditionally, coaches have the athlete focus on the internal movement of skills. For example, feedback statements such as “keep your elbows locked”or “reach and snap” have been the standard performance cues used for teaching the basic skills of volleyball. While such statements focus on the movement action rather than the effects of the movement, motor learning research suggests that focusing on the external effects of movement also has a positive effect on skill acquisition. As volleyball coaches, we should explore the effectiveness of using a more external focus of attention when instructing our athletes. For example, when teaching the basic overhand serve, instead of cues such as “keep your elbow high; step forward with the opposite foot, and reach and make contact,” shift the focus to the external effects and see the results. External focus cues might include “see the ball up, step towards the target”, or “hand to the ball to the serving zone.” When providing feedback for the basic pass, teaching cues such as “keep the ball low” or “see the pass to the target” might be added with “thumbs together and lock elbows” or “lift with the legs.” An external focus enables the performer not to concentrate so much on the movement itself, but rather on the effect or outcome of the movement and is effective. Coaches always desire to enhance the performance of their athletes. Information from various disciplines such as motor learning can help assist the coach with this process.\nMy own comments:\nWhen practicing your chosen skill you could apply this PML by shifting from internal to external focus and assess whether the principle was effective. As pointed by Denny (2010), by focusing on external features of the performance learners will pay less attention to the movement itself. This is especially helpful when the learners are moving from the cognitive to the associative state of learning. When reading the content of chapter 12 (Magill & Anderson, 2017), you will realize that learners entering the Fitts and Posner second stage of learning (associative) will focus less and less on the specific movements needed to perform a given skill.\n\n\n#6 –Augmented feedback principle (Feedback is Essential for Skill Learning)\nPerhaps there is no more conclusive evidence in motor learning literature than the effectiveness of feedback to enhance skill acquisition. In addition to task intrinsic feedback, which is provided through the senses of the learner, augmented feedback provides additional information helping the learner acquire the desired skill performance. A coach providing appropriate augmented feedback to the player regarding the performance of a skill is very helpful. Augmented feedback may come in different forms such as a coach providing verbal feedback. For example, when the coach remarks, “You served 8 of 10 balls in-bounds in zone three,” this type of augmented feedback is called knowledge of results. While KR is often redundant with task intrinsic feedback, it may be needed when task intrinsic is not available or is unclear. Another type of verbal feedback is knowledge of performance. KP is when information is given regarding the specific characteristics of the performance. For example, a coach using KP informs the hitter that she dropped her elbow prior to the spike. This type of verbal information is descriptive knowledge of performance, as the feedback “describes” the act, and is recommended for more advanced players. For beginners, prescriptive KP is more effective such as telling a beginner to keep their elbow high when spiking. Besides verbal feedback, other examples of using augmented feedback include videotape recordings and movement kinematics such as the Dartfish software program.\nMy own comments:\nWhen practicing your chosen skill you should definitely incorporate this MLP into your practice. There are several ways to receive feedback while practicing and a length discussion is provided in our text. Even if you decide not to add this MLP in your reflection piece, considering it during practice will help you tremendously.\n\n\nPrinciple #7 – Augmented feedback principle (More Is Not Always Better)\nWhile feedback is extremely beneficial in skill acquisition, more is not necessarily better. In fact, asking learners to rate their own performance before providing augmented feedback may actually enhance the feedback effectiveness and help players not become so dependent on the coach providing all the feedback. There are numerous ways to decrease the amount of feedback provided, helping players become independent learners. For example, having players perform several attempts of a skill before providing augmented feedback (called summary feedback) can allow them to engage in a cognitive/kinesthetic skill analysis before hearing from the coach. A method called self-selected feedback suggests players only receive feedback from the coach when the players request feedback. Another approach of providing less rather than more feedback is termed “bandwidth feedback” which entails establishing an acceptable range or criterion of performance error, and only providing feedback once the player is outside that range. These approaches for reducing feedback delivery are helpful for coaches and players since it is a systematic reduction of feedback based on individual skill levels. So while feedback is essential for skill learning, more is not always better.\nMy own comments:\nThe principle #7, which was discussed by Denny (2010), is simply an extension of principle #6. As you will see, Magill and Anderson (2017) will address principle #6 and #7 as one single principle and call it Augmented Feedback (Chapter 15).\n\n\nPrinciple #8 – Whole vs Part practice principle (Consider Organization and Complexity When Practicing the Whole Skill or Part of the Skill)\nPerhaps no other motor learning topic is debated as much as the whole/part practice question. When practicing a volleyball skill, which type is more effective? To practice the entire skill or to practice parts of the skill? One way for volleyball coaches to solve this dilemma is to conduct a skill analysis for each of the six volleyball skills (serving, passing, setting, hitting, blocking, and digging) and determine the complexity and the organization of each skill. The complexity of the skill consists of the number of parts or components while the organization of the skill involves the relationship among the various parts. If a skill is highly organized, it means that one part is dependent on the previous components. After doing the skill’s task analysis, the general principle is if the skill is high in complexity and low in organization then the part method is better. For example, serving in volleyball would involve several components or parts to the skill, but these parts are not interdependent to one another; so the part method would be more appropriate. However, when a skill is low in complexity and high in organization practicing the whole skill is more appropriate. For example, spiking in volleyball involves parts that are highly dependent on one another. The approach, jump, and arm swing all work interdependently in order for the entire skill to be successful, thus the whole method is more appropriate, and this is especially true when working with beginners. The whole/part debate will continue among volleyball coaches, but determining the complexity and organization of the various skills may provide some guidance regarding which practice approach is better to use during practice skill instruction.\nMy own comments:\nThis is a very important principle that will help you when practicing your chosen skill. You will realize that practicing juggling as a whole will produce the best results. This is because juggling is considered high and complexity and high organization (refer to Magill & Anderson, 2017 for details). Now, some will find it helpful to practice a simplified version of the skill (a type of part practice called simplification). Practicing with scarves, for instance, is an example. Notice that you are not trying to apply the part practice to the actual characteristics of the skill of juggling (see the listed 7 characteristics in the picture below).\nNow, with the skill of speed cup stacking, one would benefit by employing the part practice method. In this case, the complexity is high but the organization is low. We break up the skill into parts and practice each part separately before practicing it as a whole. For instance, when practicing the 3-6-3 sequence, it is recommended that you practice the 3 up/down part separate from the 6 up/down part.\n\n\nPrinciple #9- Distribution of practice principle (Practices Should Be Short and Frequent)\nThis principle relates to mass versus distributed practice schedules. A mass practice schedule will have fewer practice sessions than a distributed schedule and will be fewer in number, while a distributed practice schedule will have the same amount of time allotment, but across more sessions making the sessions shorter in length. For the majority of volleyball coaches, decisions regarding the amount of practice time may or may not be within their control, but how long each practice is, and how often the team should practice are legitimate concerns that need to be addressed. The motor learning research suggests that practices can be too long and not as productive as shorter practices, so when in doubt, go for a shorter practice session, rather than a longer one. If more practice is needed, add additional practice sessions instead of lengthening the specific practice schedule.\nMy own comments:\nConsider using this PML when practicing your chosen skill. Your practice sessions should be short with some time for resting in between sessions.\n\n\nPrinciple #10- If You Want To Get Better at Playing Volleyball, Play the Game of Volleyball\nThe final motor learning principle for coaches to remember repeats the first tenant presented at the beginning of this series. Since repetition aids learning, this critical principle needs repeating; practice like the game. The best practices increase skill learning that can be transferred to the real game setting. During practice, if coaches increase time on game-related skills and increase opportunities to learn the skills in the context of the game, players will get better at playing the game of volleyball. Remember when volleyball coaches had players passing, setting, or spiking against the wall during practices. The question no one asked was “how often during the volleyball game will”passing”, “setting”, or “spiking” against the wall be necessary”? Many of our practice drills do not simulate the game conditions. It has been stated that the best passing drill is a pass/set/hit drill; the best setting drill is a pass/set/hit drill, and the best hitting drill is a pass/set/hit drill. In other words, if you want to get better at playing the game, then play the game. For volleyball coaches, this means designing drills to simulate the same skills needed in the game. If it isn’t game-like, don’t do it. Always be analyzing practices, changing drills, and incorporating mini-games, wash drills, and controlled scrimmages, so that practice looks like the game of volleyball. If you want your players to get better at playing volleyball, then let them play volleyball.\nEffective volleyball coaches work hard to enhance the performance of their players. Information from various disciplines such as motor learning can help assist them with this process. This article looked at 10 principles from motor learning literature along with applications for teaching/coaching volleyball skills. Although certainly not exhaustive of all motor learning concepts, these principles do provide a solid pedagogical foundation for coaches developing successful players and effective teams.\nMy own comments:\nRefer to principle #1"

    "text": "One of the major requirements of this course is to learn how to perform a motor skill (either Hand Juggling or Speed Cup Stacking). You will be required to practice, learn, and show proof of mastery for the selected skill by video recording your performance.\nIn addition to learning the skill of your preference, you will be required to write a reflection paper discussing your experience.\nNOTE: If you have mastered Hand Juggling and Speed Cup Stacking, contact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss alternative skills you may select to practice. Note that you may be asked to prove you have mastered both skills before you are assigned a new skill.\n\n\nYou will be given the option to choose the skill to practice and learn.\nYou will learn in this course that Juggling and Cup Speed Stacking are placed under two different categories as far as motor learning is concerned. Each skill has different cognitive and motor skill demands. Juggling is categorized as a continuous skill. Continuous skills have not detectable beginning and end once the performer has started performing it. Cup Speed Stacking on the other hand is considered a discrete skill, which has a clear beginning and end. One begins by stacking up the first “three” on the left/right and ends by stacking down the opposite “three” (left/right).\nMy suggestion:\n\nWatch the demo videos below for both skills;\nPick the one that is most appealing to you;\nComplete the tutorial for the chosen skill (Appendix B);\nAcquire the proper equipment and start practicing as per the recommendations outlined in this course;\nWhen released, complete the update assignments (1, and 2);\nIf after completing the Update 2 assignment you feel the chosen skill is not for you, contact the instructor ASAP to receive permission to switch skills.\n\n\n\n\nHand juggling requires lots of practice, and the amount of time needed to master this motor skill will depend on a number of factors. Dedication, focus, discipline, along with the use of motor learning strategies (Motor Learning Principles) are just some of these factors.\nSome have claimed (and demonstrated) that juggling can be learned in 24 hours, or even 10 minutes.\nFor this assignment, you will be given plenty of time to learn the skill (up to 4 months if taking this course in the fall or spring).\n\n\nIf you select the skill of hand juggling to practice and learn, you will be required to:\n\nJuggle 3 objects continuously for at least 5 seconds to receive the full points under the evaluation category of TIME (refer to the evaluation rubric for this assignment). \nYou can earn 5 extra points if you continuously juggle 3 objects for at least 10 seconds (using the correct technique). \n\n\n\n\nThe “exchange continuous” technique is the only technique that will be accepted if you select the skill of juggling 3 objects. Watch the video below to have a sense of what this technique looks like.\nKIN 377 Keith Makiuchi Juggling\n\n\nBelow are some examples of techniques that you should NOT use. Although it is possible to “juggle” using different techniques, the alternative techniques discussed below WILL NOT be accepted. If you are unsure, contact Dr. Furtado to verify if the technique you are practicing will be accepted.\n\n\n\nJuggling with a pause\nJuggling in circling motion\n\n\n\n\nSome might use this technique during the early stages of skill learning, as a practice technique. However, the videos recorded for the learning updates and the final submission should not depict this technique.\nAgain, some might use this technique during the early stages of skill learning, as a practice technique. However, the videos recorded for the learning updates and the final submission should not depict this technique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose 3 objects to use when practicing this skill.\nThe only exception is that you cannot use scarves, plastic bags, or anything light that makes the “exchange” process easier. As you will see in the tutorial, scarves or plastic bags are used at the beginning of the learning process when learners need more time to think during the exchange. This is a learning technique that may be used to learn this skill, but you should NOT submit the final video (or the updates) juggling scarves or plastic bags.  \nAlthough not required, I encourage you to purchase a set of 3 mini juggling balls if you choose this skill. Amazon sells a set of 3 for about $6. Here is the link → http://goo.gl/5VHs9d\nI’ve put together a tutorial (APPENDIX B) that is meant to help you before and after you start practicing.\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice a few hours per day. Learning a motor skill takes time and practice. Waiting until the end of the term to begin practicing is a really bad idea.\nAs you practice the skill, use the Motor Learning Principles (APPENDIX C) that will be taught in this course. For example, jugglers use the Principle of Simplification when learning to juggle 3 objects:\nThey begin by tossing a single object up with one hand and catching with the opposite hand. Then, they proceed by using 2 objects, and then 3 objects. There are many other Motor Learning Principles that can be used when learning the skill of juggling. Note that this technique SHOULD NOT be used when recording the Update or Final video performance; this technique should only be used for training purposes. \nTo earn the full points for TIME, student must juggle continuously for 5 seconds or more. The full evaluation criteria will be released soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you select the skill of cup stacking to practice and learn, you will be required to perform the technique called 3-6-3 (watch the video below) and finish the “up & down” at or under 10 seconds to receive full points. You can earn some extra points (up to 5 points) if you complete the 3-6-3 “up & down” at or under 5:00 seconds.\nVisit the link below for an example that depicts the technique you will be required to learn if you choose this skill:\nhttps://youtu.be/OjEH3ugV6mM\n\n\n\nPurchase a set of 12 professional cups online or from a local toy store.

Learning a motor skill takes time and practice. Waiting until the end of the term to begin practicing is a really bad idea.\nAs you practice the skill, use the Motor Learning Principles that will be taught in this course. For example, learners can employ the concept of “Whole Practice vs Part Practice” when learning the skill. Instead of trying to learn the 3-6-3 (Whole Practice), one can learn the “3” and the “6” steps separately (Part Practice).\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must video record yourself while performing the chosen skill. Although students are free to choose the device of their choice, using a tablet, smartphone or even a laptop\n\n\n\nPick a place with decent lighting\nChoose your device; it could be your cell phone, a tablet, or even a computer \nPractice several trials while the camera is off\nWhen ready, record a sequence of THREE trials with intervals of 3 seconds in between trials.\nHere is the sequence:\n\nTurn on the camera\nPosition yourself in front of the camera (ensure your face appears on camera)\n\nWait 3 seconds ⟶ TRIAL 1 \nWait 3 seconds ⟶ TRIAL 2\nWait 3 seconds ⟶ TRIAL 3\n\nTurn off the camera; you are done!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recording must be done continuously. Do not pause the video, especially in between trials; nor should the recorded sequence be edited in ANY FORM - IF YOU DO, THE VIDEO WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU.\nAny submission containing a video that does not conform to the requirements of the items above will be returned to the student. Note that the “late assignment” policy will be applied in such a case (refer to our Syllabus for more info). \nThough not required, it is recommended that you ask someone to video record you as that person can move and follow you in case you move around during the performance;\nIf you juggle the object for 10 seconds (any of the 3 attempts), you may stop at 10 seconds since this is the minimum required to earn the extra points (refer to the Grading Rubrics);\nYou MUST record 3 attempts, even if you got 10 seconds on the first and/or the second attempt;\n\nI will consider your best attempt for grading purposes, not the average of the 3 attempts.\n\nDO NOT record more than 3 attempts. If you recorded 3 trials and for some reason, you are not happy with the result, you will have to start all over. ONLY submit a video that has 3 attempts.\nYou must provide the time it took you to complete each attempt. ONCE THE FINAL VIDEO IS RECORDED, WATCH IT AND USE A TIMER (CELL PHONE) TO TIME EACH ATTEMPT. WRITE IT DOWN SINCE YOU WILL NEED TO SUBMIT THE TIME IT TOOK YOU TO COMPLETE EACH ATTEMPT WITH THE VIDEO. YOU WILL DO IT BY ADDING ADDING A COMMENT TO THE SUBMITTED VIDEO. For instance:\n\nAttempt 1 →  4:34 (4 seconds and 34 milliseconds)\nAttempt 2 →  2:24 (2 seconds and 24 milliseconds)\nAttempt 3 →  1:11 (1 second and 11 milliseconds)\n\nNote that you should NOT add up the time of each attempt so that:\n\n4:34\n6:58 (4:34+2:24)\n7:69 (4:34+2:24+1:11)\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the steps below to submit the video you recorded to fulfill the requirements of either the Update 2 or Final Video Performance assignment for the chosen skill (Juggling or Cup Stacking).\n\nRecord the video for the assignment in question (Update 2 or Final Video Performance)\nUsing a computer or tablet, open Canvas and locate the assignment in question\nClick on Start Assignment\nAttach your video to the submission and submit the assignment\n\n\n\n\nYou will be submitting several updates throughout the semester (a 6-week period for summer sessions).

    "text": "One of the major requirements of this course is to learn how to perform a motor skill (either Hand Juggling or Speed Cup Stacking). You will be required to practice, learn, and show proof of mastery for the selected skill by video recording your performance.\nIn addition to learning the skill of your preference, you will be required to write a reflection paper discussing your experience.\nNOTE: If you have mastered Hand Juggling and Speed Cup Stacking, contact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss alternative skills you may select to practice. Note that you may be asked to prove you have mastered both skills before you are assigned a new skill.\n\n\nYou will be given the option to choose the skill to practice and learn.\nYou will learn in this course that Juggling and Cup Speed Stacking are placed under two different categories as far as motor learning is concerned. Each skill has different cognitive and motor skill demands. Juggling is categorized as a continuous skill. Continuous skills have not detectable beginning and end once the performer has started performing it. Cup Speed Stacking on the other hand is considered a discrete skill, which has a clear beginning and end. One begins by stacking up the first “three” on the left/right and ends by stacking down the opposite “three” (left/right).\nMy suggestion:\n\nWatch the demo videos below for both skills;\nPick the one that is most appealing to you;\nComplete the tutorial for the chosen skill (Appendix B);\nAcquire the proper equipment and start practicing as per the recommendations outlined in this course;\nWhen released, complete the update assignments (1, and 2);\nIf after completing the Update 2 assignment you feel the chosen skill is not for you, contact the instructor ASAP to receive permission to switch skills.\n\n\n\n\nHand juggling requires lots of practice, and the amount of time needed to master this motor skill will depend on a number of factors. Dedication, focus, discipline, along with the use of motor learning strategies (Motor Learning Principles) are just some of these factors.\nSome have claimed (and demonstrated) that juggling can be learned in 24 hours, or even 10 minutes.\nFor this assignment, you will be given plenty of time to learn the skill (up to 4 months if taking this course in the fall or spring).\n\n\nIf you select the skill of hand juggling to practice and learn, you will be required to:\n\nJuggle 3 objects continuously for at least 5 seconds to receive the full points under the evaluation category of TIME (refer to the evaluation rubric for this assignment). \nYou can earn 5 extra points if you continuously juggle 3 objects for at least 10 seconds (using the correct technique). \n\n\n\n\nThe “exchange continuous” technique is the only technique that will be accepted if you select the skill of juggling 3 objects. Watch the video below to have a sense of what this technique looks like.\nKIN 377 Keith Makiuchi Juggling\n\n\nBelow are some examples of techniques that you should NOT use. Although it is possible to “juggle” using different techniques, the alternative techniques discussed below WILL NOT be accepted. If you are unsure, contact Dr. Furtado to verify if the technique you are practicing will be accepted.\n\n\n\nJuggling with a pause\nJuggling in circling motion\n\n\n\n\nSome might use this technique during the early stages of skill learning, as a practice technique. However, the videos recorded for the learning updates and the final submission should not depict this technique.\nAgain, some might use this technique during the early stages of skill learning, as a practice technique. However, the videos recorded for the learning updates and the final submission should not depict this technique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose 3 objects to use when practicing this skill.\nThe only exception is that you cannot use scarves, plastic bags, or anything light that makes the “exchange” process easier. As you will see in the tutorial, scarves or plastic bags are used at the beginning of the learning process when learners need more time to think during the exchange. This is a learning technique that may be used to learn this skill, but you should NOT submit the final video (or the updates) juggling scarves or plastic bags.  \nAlthough not required, I encourage you to purchase a set of 3 mini juggling balls if you choose this skill. Amazon sells a set of 3 for about $6. Here is the link → http://goo.gl/5VHs9d\nI’ve put together a tutorial (APPENDIX B) that is meant to help you before and after you start practicing.\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice a few hours per day. Learning a motor skill takes time and practice. Waiting until the end of the term to begin practicing is a really bad idea.\nAs you practice the skill, use the Motor Learning Principles (APPENDIX C) that will be taught in this course. For example, jugglers use the Principle of Simplification when learning to juggle 3 objects:\nThey begin by tossing a single object up with one hand and catching with the opposite hand. Then, they proceed by using 2 objects, and then 3 objects. There are many other Motor Learning Principles that can be used when learning the skill of juggling. Note that this technique SHOULD NOT be used when recording the Update or Final video performance; this technique should only be used for training purposes. \nTo earn the full points for TIME, student must juggle continuously for 5 seconds or more. The full evaluation criteria will be released soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you select the skill of cup stacking to practice and learn, you will be required to perform the technique called 3-6-3 (watch the video below) and finish the “up & down” at or under 10 seconds to receive full points. You can earn some extra points (up to 5 points) if you complete the 3-6-3 “up & down” at or under 5:00 seconds.\nVisit the link below for an example that depicts the technique you will be required to learn if you choose this skill:\nhttps://youtu.be/OjEH3ugV6mM\n\n\n\nPurchase a set of 12 professional cups online or from a local toy store.

Your paper will be returned if any of the three principles you selected is not in the list below.\nThe “stages of learning” principle, DOES NOT count as one of the three principles you will be selecting. The stages of the learning principle will be a separate section of your paper. Thus, you will be discussing 4 principles as part of your paper.

The trade-off is that increasing speed yields decreasing accuracy, and vice versa.\n\n[CH09] Action-effect principle (hypothesis) - internal vs external focus\n\nThe proposition that actions are best planned and controlled by their intended effects. When related to attention focus, this hypothesis proposes that the learning and performance of skills are optimized when the performer’s attention is directed to the intended outcome of the action rather than on the movements themselves.\n\n[CH11] Encoding specificity principle\n\nA memory principle that indicates the close relationship between encoding and retrieval memory processes. It states that memory test performance is directly related to the amount of similarity between the practice and the test contexts; i.e., the more similarity, the better the test performance will be.\n\n[CH13] Transfer of learning principle - positive or negative\n\nThe influence of prior learning on the learning of a new skill or the performance of a skill in a new context.\n\n[CH14] Augmented feedback principle - concurrent, terminal, etc.\n\nA generic term used to describe information about a performance that supplements the sensory feedback and comes from a source external to the performer; it is sometimes referred to as extrinsic or external feedback.\n\n[CH14] Cognitive mediation theory (principle)\n\nA theory for explaining the benefit of a demonstration proposing that when a person observes a skilled model, the person translates the observed movement information into a cognitive code that the person stores in memory and uses when the observer performs the skill.\n\n[CH16] Practice variability principle - random vs blocked practice\n\nThe memory and performance disruption (i.e., interference) that results from performing multiple skills or variations of a skill within the context of practice.\n\n[CH17] Distribution of practice principle - Distributed vs Massed\n\nDistributed is a practice schedule in which the amount of rest between practice sessions or trials is relatively long. Massed is a practice schedule in which the amount of rest between practice sessions or trials is very short.\n\n[CH17] Overlearning\n\nA practice that continues beyond the amount needed to achieve a certain performance criterion.\n\n[CH18] Whole vs part practice principle (more info here)\n\nSkills that are high in organization and low in complexity are best served through whole practice. The part practice method generally involves breaking down the skill into natural parts or segments, practicing those parts separately until they are learned, and then integrating them to perform the skill in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, you will find the paper written by Dr. Denny in which she discusses the application of several MLPs in coaching volleyball. YOU MUST READ THE ARTICLE BELOW AND COMPLETE THE ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE ARTICLE - LT Update 3\n\nFollowing each principle, I provide my own comments. The purpose of this article (and my comments) is to help you when completing the Learning Task assignment\nThe original titles have been modified to match my assignment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Applying Motor Learning Principles in Coaching Volleyball\nBy Vickie Grooms Denny, Ph.D.\nJournal: Coaching Volleyball, June/July 2010\nAPA Style reference\nDenny, V. (2010). Applying motor learning principles in coaching volleyball. Coaching Volleyball Magazine, (June/July), 24–25.\nCoaching volleyball is enhanced when coaches draw from a variety of disciplines to assist in teaching skill development. The discipline of motor learning focuses on the acquisition of motor skills and/or the improvement of motor skills and involves principles that can be implemented by coaches to aid in volleyball skill acquisition. Coaches using principles from motor learning literature will enable players to reach their full potential in learning and developing volleyball skills leading to a more effective performance on the court. The following is a two-part series, summarizing various principles from motor learning research and making applications for coaching the sport of volleyball.\n\n3.3.1 Principle #1: Encoding specificity principle (The Practice Conditions Should Be Like the Game)\nIt has been stated that if you want to learn how to play the game, then play the game. In motor learning, this is a memory principle called the “encoding specificity principle” which suggests that the more closely aligned the practice context is to the game context, the better the game performance. For volleyball coaches, this means striving to make the practice conditions as much like the game conditions as possible. For example, if you know you will be playing in a gym with a very low ceiling, practice passing balls at a lower level. If you are going to face a big middle hitter who cuts the angles in your next match, then have someone hitting those angles in practice. If you want your players to perform well during stressful games, set up similar pressure situations during practice. For example, playing loud music, making bad calls, or putting the server on the end-line to serve for game point after a long rally, are all examples of making practice more like the game. Practices would include everything and anything that could possibly be experienced during the game. As a coach, look for ways to guarantee players have already practiced everything before they actually see it in the real game, and always be analyzing practices by evaluating how well you are training your players for actual game performance.\nMy own comments:\nThe practice conditions should approximate as much as possible the test conditions. In practicing the chosen skill, consider this principle. Because you will be required to video record yourself, it is important you video record yourself a couple of times while practicing. Performers tend to get nervous when they find out they have to perform in front of other people and/or in front of the camera.\nIn addition, it is essential you are consistent when it comes to equipment and location. You must choose the equipment that will be used during practice asap.\nIf juggling is your choice, then you must decide whether to use bean bags, balls, or any other object. I strongly advise you to choose the small bean bags you can find in local toy stores or Amazon (https://goo.gl/yvaWU5).\nIf speed cup stacking is your choice, you must decide which kind of cups you will use for practice. Last time I checked, this set of cups (https://goo.gl/QrJZU9) was less than $5 on Amazon. Do NOT choose regular plastic cups as they will negatively affect your performance.\n\n\n3.3.2 Principle #2: Practice variability principle - The Practice Conditions Should Provide for Variability (blocked vs random)\nA second motor learning principle that is closely related to the encoding principle is called the “contextual interference principle” which stresses that random types of practice conditions are usually best. For example, if you are working on passing, it is best not to just practice passing from the same spot over and over again. This is called block practice and is not at all like the game of volleyball. How often does the player stand in one spot passing ten balls in a row from the same server from the same area? In random practice, the player might be asked to serve-receive 10 different types of serves from 10 different places from several different types of servers on the court. This random practice schedule best prepares passers to receive in the game. A further application would be after serve-receive, have players practice coming in for different types of sets and hits along the net with a full team coverage formation. Random practice has been proven to be effective in most situations. The only time random practice is discouraged is with beginners. For beginning players, coaches should start with a block schedule, practicing the same skill in the same way under the same condition repeatedly. The problem with most coaches, however, is that they continue this blocked practice schedule long after the athlete has acquired the basic skill pattern. Once the basic skill is demonstrated, random practice should be introduced.\nMy own comments:\nRandom practice variability is more useful when learning “open skills”. Both juggling and speed cup stacking areconsidered “closed skills”, and, therefore, requires blocked practice. With open skills, the environmental features determine when to begin the action. In basketball, for instance, when dribbling the ball toward the basket while opponents are trying to steal the ball. This is an example of “open skill” since the features of the environment are not predictable. On the other hand, the free-throw shooting in basketball is considered a “closed skill”. The features of the environment are predictable and the player decides when to initiate the action.\n\n\n3.3.3 Principle #3: Learning Occurs in Three Distinct Stages\nMotor learning is complex and consists of three distinct stages. The cognitive stage is when the learner creates a mental picture of the skill to be executed along with processing the visual, kinesthetic, and auditory cues needed for the skill. Performance during this initial stage is full of questions and errors as the learner attempts to get an idea of how to do the skill. During the second stage, called the associative stage, the learner begins to understand how to do the skill and “associates” the movement with environmental cues. This stage is sometimes called the refining stage since learners begin to narrow the motor response and identify and correct errors on their own. The final stage of motor learning is termed the autonomous stage since the performance of the skill is now automatic. At this stage the learned skill is now a habit, requiring little attention. In order to reach this highest level, many years of practice are needed, and not all performers will achieve this final stage. For coaches, it is important to identify which stage a player is present since different stages require different coaching skills. During the initial cognitive stage, appropriate and timely feedback is needed to help the novice performer understand how to do the skill and how to correct errors. The coach is providing lots of encouragement along with appropriate feedback during the cognitive stage. During the associative stage, the coach’s role shifts towards refining techniques. During this stage, the coach waits and allows the player to identify his or her own performance errors and correction. While the emphasis is on refinement, there are ample opportunities for practice to develop the consistency of the skill performance. Working with athletes in the final autonomous stage, the role of the coach again is different. Now the emphasis is on developing strategies and tactics for using the skill in a variety of game situations.\nMy own comments:\nNote that I do not consider the stages of learning as a motor learning principle per se. I treat the stages of learning as a separate section of the Reflection Paper (please refer to this assignment for more information).\n\n\n3.3.4 Principle #4: Transfer of learning principle (Consider Transfer of Learning When Teaching New Motor Skills)\nTransfer of learning is the effect previous experiences have on the learning of a new skill or performing a skill in a new context. The concept of transfer lays the foundation for all of skill learning. Transfer of learning can be positive, negative, or neutral. Volleyball coaches should be aware of the transfer of learning effect and utilize it to help with teaching new skills to players or teaching already learned skills in new contexts. Positive transfer provides the foundation for teaching skill progression. Once a skill is learned, it can be transferred to new settings, or be the foundation for new skill learning. An example of transfer would be the overhand throwing pattern. Early in a child’s development, the correct overhand pattern should be established. This skill can then be applied across different settings and into new sport skills. In volleyball the spike and jump serve both derive from the basic overhand pattern. Ensure that this fundamental skill is acquired at an early age so that positive transfer can occur later in volleyball skill learning. While positive transfer is a powerful tool, coaches should be aware of the role that negative transfer can play as well. Although negative transfer is temporary, it does initially hinder or hurt learning a new skill. In volleyball, an example of this could be when players initially learn to jump off two feet when spiking, and then the coach tries to teach the basic one-foot take-off for the slide. Since negative transfer is not permanent, the coach should be patient as players work on learning similar, but different skills.\nMy own comments:\nWhen practicing your chosen skill reflect upon previous experience acquired when practicing a similar skill. When doing so, consider whether there was a positive or negative transfer of learning when learning juggling or speed cup stacking. If so, you may discuss how such an experience affected the learning process of your chosen skill. Make sure to provide details.\n\n\n3.3.5 Principle #5: Action-effect principle (Focus Attention on the Movement Effects Rather Than Just the Movement)\nTraditionally, coaches have the athlete focus on the internal movement of skills. For example, feedback statements such as “keep your elbows locked”or “reach and snap” have been the standard performance cues used for teaching the basic skills of volleyball. While such statements focus on the movement action rather than the effects of the movement, motor learning research suggests that focusing on the external effects of movement also has a positive effect on skill acquisition. As volleyball coaches, we should explore the effectiveness of using a more external focus of attention when instructing our athletes. For example, when teaching the basic overhand serve, instead of cues such as “keep your elbow high; step forward with the opposite foot, and reach and make contact,” shift the focus to the external effects and see the results. External focus cues might include “see the ball up, step towards the target”, or “hand to the ball to the serving zone.” When providing feedback for the basic pass, teaching cues such as “keep the ball low” or “see the pass to the target” might be added with “thumbs together and lock elbows” or “lift with the legs.” An external focus enables the performer not to concentrate so much on the movement itself, but rather on the effect or outcome of the movement and is effective. Coaches always desire to enhance the performance of their athletes. Information from various disciplines such as motor learning can help assist the coach with this process.\nMy own comments:\nWhen practicing your chosen skill you could apply this PML by shifting from internal to external focus and assess whether the principle was effective. As pointed by Denny (2010), by focusing on external features of the performance learners will pay less attention to the movement itself. This is especially helpful when the learners are moving from the cognitive to the associative state of learning. When reading the content of chapter 12 (Magill & Anderson, 2017), you will realize that learners entering the Fitts and Posner second stage of learning (associative) will focus less and less on the specific movements needed to perform a given skill.\n\n\n3.3.6 #6 –Augmented feedback principle (Feedback is Essential for Skill Learning)\nPerhaps there is no more conclusive evidence in motor learning literature than the effectiveness of feedback to enhance skill acquisition. In addition to task intrinsic feedback, which is provided through the senses of the learner, augmented feedback provides additional information helping the learner acquire the desired skill performance. A coach providing appropriate augmented feedback to the player regarding the performance of a skill is very helpful. Augmented feedback may come in different forms such as a coach providing verbal feedback. For example, when the coach remarks, “You served 8 of 10 balls in-bounds in zone three,” this type of augmented feedback is called knowledge of results. While KR is often redundant with task intrinsic feedback, it may be needed when task intrinsic is not available or is unclear. Another type of verbal feedback is knowledge of performance. KP is when information is given regarding the specific characteristics of the performance. For example, a coach using KP informs the hitter that she dropped her elbow prior to the spike. This type of verbal information is descriptive knowledge of performance, as the feedback “describes” the act, and is recommended for more advanced players. For beginners, prescriptive KP is more effective such as telling a beginner to keep their elbow high when spiking. Besides verbal feedback, other examples of using augmented feedback include videotape recordings and movement kinematics such as the Dartfish software program.\nMy own comments:\nWhen practicing your chosen skill you should definitely incorporate this MLP into your practice. There are several ways to receive feedback while practicing and a length discussion is provided in our text. Even if you decide not to add this MLP in your reflection piece, considering it during practice will help you tremendously.\n\n\n3.3.7 Principle #7 – Augmented feedback principle (More Is Not Always Better)\nWhile feedback is extremely beneficial in skill acquisition, more is not necessarily better. In fact, asking learners to rate their own performance before providing augmented feedback may actually enhance the feedback effectiveness and help players not become so dependent on the coach providing all the feedback. There are numerous ways to decrease the amount of feedback provided, helping players become independent learners. For example, having players perform several attempts of a skill before providing augmented feedback (called summary feedback) can allow them to engage in a cognitive/kinesthetic skill analysis before hearing from the coach. A method called self-selected feedback suggests players only receive feedback from the coach when the players request feedback. Another approach of providing less rather than more feedback is termed “bandwidth feedback” which entails establishing an acceptable range or criterion of performance error, and only providing feedback once the player is outside that range. These approaches for reducing feedback delivery are helpful for coaches and players since it is a systematic reduction of feedback based on individual skill levels. So while feedback is essential for skill learning, more is not always better.\nMy own comments:\nThe principle #7, which was discussed by Denny (2010), is simply an extension of principle #6. As you will see, Magill and Anderson (2017) will address principle #6 and #7 as one single principle and call it Augmented Feedback (Chapter 15).\n\n\n3.3.8 Principle #8 – Whole vs Part practice principle (Consider Organization and Complexity When Practicing the Whole Skill or Part of the Skill)\nPerhaps no other motor learning topic is debated as much as the whole/part practice question. When practicing a volleyball skill, which type is more effective? To practice the entire skill or to practice parts of the skill? One way for volleyball coaches to solve this dilemma is to conduct a skill analysis for each of the six volleyball skills (serving, passing, setting, hitting, blocking, and digging) and determine the complexity and the organization of each skill. The complexity of the skill consists of the number of parts or components while the organization of the skill involves the relationship among the various parts. If a skill is highly organized, it means that one part is dependent on the previous components. After doing the skill’s task analysis, the general principle is if the skill is high in complexity and low in organization then the part method is better. For example, serving in volleyball would involve several components or parts to the skill, but these parts are not interdependent to one another; so the part method would be more appropriate. However, when a skill is low in complexity and high in organization practicing the whole skill is more appropriate. For example, spiking in volleyball involves parts that are highly dependent on one another. The approach, jump, and arm swing all work interdependently in order for the entire skill to be successful, thus the whole method is more appropriate, and this is especially true when working with beginners. The whole/part debate will continue among volleyball coaches, but determining the complexity and organization of the various skills may provide some guidance regarding which practice approach is better to use during practice skill instruction.\nMy own comments:\nThis is a very important principle that will help you when practicing your chosen skill. You will realize that practicing juggling as a whole will produce the best results. This is because juggling is considered high and complexity and high organization (refer to Magill & Anderson, 2017 for details). Now, some will find it helpful to practice a simplified version of the skill (a type of part practice called simplification). Practicing with scarves, for instance, is an example. Notice that you are not trying to apply the part practice to the actual characteristics of the skill of juggling (see the listed 7 characteristics in the picture below).\nNow, with the skill of speed cup stacking, one would benefit by employing the part practice method. In this case, the complexity is high but the organization is low. We break up the skill into parts and practice each part separately before practicing it as a whole. For instance, when practicing the 3-6-3 sequence, it is recommended that you practice the 3 up/down part separate from the 6 up/down part.\n\n\n3.3.9 Principle #9- Distribution of practice principle (Practices Should Be Short and Frequent)\nThis principle relates to mass versus distributed practice schedules. A mass practice schedule will have fewer practice sessions than a distributed schedule and will be fewer in number, while a distributed practice schedule will have the same amount of time allotment, but across more sessions making the sessions shorter in length. For the majority of volleyball coaches, decisions regarding the amount of practice time may or may not be within their control, but how long each practice is, and how often the team should practice are legitimate concerns that need to be addressed. The motor learning research suggests that practices can be too long and not as productive as shorter practices, so when in doubt, go for a shorter practice session, rather than a longer one. If more practice is needed, add additional practice sessions instead of lengthening the specific practice schedule.\nMy own comments:\nConsider using this PML when practicing your chosen skill. Your practice sessions should be short with some time for resting in between sessions.\n\n\n3.3.10 Principle #10- If You Want To Get Better at Playing Volleyball, Play the Game of Volleyball\nThe final motor learning principle for coaches to remember repeats the first tenant presented at the beginning of this series. Since repetition aids learning, this critical principle needs repeating; practice like the game. The best practices increase skill learning that can be transferred to the real game setting. During practice, if coaches increase time on game-related skills and increase opportunities to learn the skills in the context of the game, players will get better at playing the game of volleyball. Remember when volleyball coaches had players passing, setting, or spiking against the wall during practices. The question no one asked was “how often during the volleyball game will”passing”, “setting”, or “spiking” against the wall be necessary”? Many of our practice drills do not simulate the game conditions. It has been stated that the best passing drill is a pass/set/hit drill; the best setting drill is a pass/set/hit drill, and the best hitting drill is a pass/set/hit drill. In other words, if you want to get better at playing the game, then play the game. For volleyball coaches, this means designing drills to simulate the same skills needed in the game. If it isn’t game-like, don’t do it. Always be analyzing practices, changing drills, and incorporating mini-games, wash drills, and controlled scrimmages, so that practice looks like the game of volleyball. If you want your players to get better at playing volleyball, then let them play volleyball.\nEffective volleyball coaches work hard to enhance the performance of their players. Information from various disciplines such as motor learning can help assist them with this process. This article looked at 10 principles from motor learning literature along with applications for teaching/coaching volleyball skills. Although certainly not exhaustive of all motor learning concepts, these principles do provide a solid pedagogical foundation for coaches developing successful players and effective teams.\nMy own comments:\nRefer to principle #1"

When performing the exchange technique (required for this activity), at a given point, performers need to hold two objects in one hand. This becomes a problem if large objects are being used; i.e., tennis balls.\n\n\n\n\nSpeed Stacks Sport Stacking Set\nIf you choose to learn the cup stacking, I recommend you to acquire the cups used in national and international tournaments, or grab a set of less expensive ones from Amazon or elsewhere.\n\nDO NOT USE ORDINARY PLASTIC CUPS WHEN PRACTICING AS THEY ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR CUP STACKING. These cups will significantly affect your performance and your grade, in case you choose cup stacking as your learning task."

    "text": "Appendix A\nOne of the major requirements of this course is to learn how to perform a motor skill (either Hand Juggling or Speed Cup Stacking). You will be required to practice, learn, and show proof of mastery for the selected skill by video recording your performance.\nIn addition to learning the skill of your preference, you will be required to write a reflection paper discussing your experience.\nNOTE: If you have mastered Hand Juggling and Speed Cup Stacking, contact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss alternative skills you may select to practice. Note that you may be asked to prove you have mastered both skills before you are assigned a new skill.\n\nThe choice of skill\nYou will be given the option to choose the skill to practice and learn.\nYou will learn in this course that Juggling and Cup Speed Stacking are placed under two different categories as far as motor learning is concerned. Each skill has different cognitive and motor skill demands. Juggling is categorized as a continuous skill. Continuous skills have not detectable beginning and end once the performer has started performing it. Cup Speed Stacking on the other hand is considered a discrete skill, which has a clear beginning and end. One begins by stacking up the first “three” on the left/right and ends by stacking down the opposite “three” (left/right).\nMy suggestion:\n\nWatch the demo videos below for both skills;\nPick the one that is most appealing to you;\nComplete the tutorial for the chosen skill (Appendix B);\nAcquire the proper equipment and start practicing as per the recommendations outlined in this course;\nWhen released, complete the update assignments (1, and 2);\nIf after completing the Update 2 assignment you feel the chosen skill is not for you, contact the instructor ASAP to receive permission to switch skills.\n\n\n\nHand Juggling 3 objects continuously\nHand juggling requires lots of practice, and the amount of time needed to master this motor skill will depend on a number of factors. Dedication, focus, discipline, along with the use of motor learning strategies (Motor Learning Principles) are just some of these factors.\nSome have claimed (and demonstrated) that juggling can be learned in 24 hours, or even 10 minutes.\nFor this assignment, you will be given plenty of time to learn the skill (up to 4 months if taking this course in the fall or spring).\n\nJuggling Requirements\nIf you select the skill of hand juggling to practice and learn, you will be required to:\n\nJuggle 3 objects continuously for at least 5 seconds to receive the full points under the evaluation category of TIME (refer to the evaluation rubric for this assignment). \nYou can earn 5 extra points if you continuously juggle 3 objects for at least 10 seconds (using the correct technique). \n\n\n\nThe technique\nThe “exchange continuous” technique is the only technique that will be accepted if you select the skill of juggling 3 objects. Watch the video below to have a sense of what this technique looks like.\nKIN 377 Keith Makiuchi Juggling\n\nIncorrect techniques that will NOT be accepted\nBelow are some examples of techniques that you should NOT use. Although it is possible to “juggle” using different techniques, the alternative techniques discussed below WILL NOT be accepted. If you are unsure, contact Dr. Furtado to verify if the technique you are practicing will be accepted.\n\n\n\nJuggling with a pause\nJuggling in circling motion\n\n\n\n\nSome might use this technique during the early stages of skill learning, as a practice technique. However, the videos recorded for the learning updates and the final submission should not depict this technique.\nAgain, some might use this technique during the early stages of skill learning, as a practice technique. However, the videos recorded for the learning updates and the final submission should not depict this technique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you start practicing Juggling\n\nChoose 3 objects to use when practicing this skill.\nThe only exception is that you cannot use scarves, plastic bags, or anything light that makes the “exchange” process easier. As you will see in the tutorial, scarves or plastic bags are used at the beginning of the learning process when learners need more time to think during the exchange. This is a learning technique that may be used to learn this skill, but you should NOT submit the final video (or the updates) juggling scarves or plastic bags.  \nAlthough not required, I encourage you to purchase a set of 3 mini juggling balls if you choose this skill. Amazon sells a set of 3 for about $6. Here is the link → http://goo.gl/5VHs9d\nI’ve put together a tutorial (APPENDIX B) that is meant to help you before and after you start practicing.\n\n\n\nThings to consider when practicing Juggling\n\nPractice a few hours per day. Learning a motor skill takes time and practice. Waiting until the end of the term to begin practicing is a really bad idea.\nAs you practice the skill, use the Motor Learning Principles (APPENDIX C) that will be taught in this course. For example, jugglers use the Principle of Simplification when learning to juggle 3 objects:\nThey begin by tossing a single object up with one hand and catching with the opposite hand. Then, they proceed by using 2 objects, and then 3 objects. There are many other Motor Learning Principles that can be used when learning the skill of juggling. Note that this technique SHOULD NOT be used when recording the Update or Final video performance; this technique should only be used for training purposes. \nTo earn the full points for TIME, student must juggle continuously for 5 seconds or more. The full evaluation criteria will be released soon.\n\n\n\n\nSpeed Cup Stacking\nIf you select the skill of cup stacking to practice and learn, you will be required to perform the technique called 3-6-3 (watch the video below) and finish the “up & down” at or under 10 seconds to receive full points. You can earn some extra points (up to 5 points) if you complete the 3-6-3 “up & down” at or under 5:00 seconds.\nVisit the link below for an example that depicts the technique you will be required to learn if you choose this skill:\nhttps://youtu.be/OjEH3ugV6mM\n\nBefore you start practicing Cup Stacking\n\nPurchase a set of 12 professional cups online or from a local toy store. Amazon sells a set of 12 cups for about $10 → https://goo.gl/q1kKiw\nI’ve put together a tutorial that is meant to help you before and after you start practicing: click here to access the tutorial\n\n\n\nThings to consider when practicing Cup Stacking\n\nIt is imperative that you practice a few hours per day. Learning a motor skill takes time and practice. Waiting until the end of the term to begin practicing is a really bad idea.\nAs you practice the skill, use the Motor Learning Principles that will be taught in this course. For example, learners can employ the concept of “Whole Practice vs Part Practice” when learning the skill. Instead of trying to learn the 3-6-3 (Whole Practice), one can learn the “3” and the “6” steps separately (Part Practice).\n\n\n\n\nVideo Recording for Juggling or Cup Stacking\nYou must video record yourself while performing the chosen skill. Although students are free to choose the device of their choice, using a tablet, smartphone or even a laptop\n\nA few things to consider:\n\nPick a place with decent lighting\nChoose your device; it could be your cell phone, a tablet, or even a computer \nPractice several trials while the camera is off\nWhen ready, record a sequence of THREE trials with intervals of 3 seconds in between trials.\nHere is the sequence:\n\nTurn on the camera\nPosition yourself in front of the camera (ensure your face appears on camera)\n\nWait 3 seconds ⟶ TRIAL 1 \nWait 3 seconds ⟶ TRIAL 2\nWait 3 seconds ⟶ TRIAL 3\n\nTurn off the camera; you are done!\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant notes\n\nThe recording must be done continuously. Do not pause the video, especially in between trials; nor should the recorded sequence be edited in ANY FORM - IF YOU DO, THE VIDEO WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU.\nAny submission containing a video that does not conform to the requirements of the items above will be returned to the student. Note that the “late assignment” policy will be applied in such a case (refer to our Syllabus for more info). \nThough not required, it is recommended that you ask someone to video record you as that person can move and follow you in case you move around during the performance;\nIf you juggle the object for 10 seconds (any of the 3 attempts), you may stop at 10 seconds since this is the minimum required to earn the extra points (refer to the Grading Rubrics);\nYou MUST record 3 attempts, even if you got 10 seconds on the first and/or the second attempt;\n\nI will consider your best attempt for grading purposes, not the average of the 3 attempts.\n\nDO NOT record more than 3 attempts. If you recorded 3 trials and for some reason, you are not happy with the result, you will have to start all over. ONLY submit a video that has 3 attempts.\nYou must provide the time it took you to complete each attempt. ONCE THE FINAL VIDEO IS RECORDED, WATCH IT AND USE A TIMER (CELL PHONE) TO TIME EACH ATTEMPT. WRITE IT DOWN SINCE YOU WILL NEED TO SUBMIT THE TIME IT TOOK YOU TO COMPLETE EACH ATTEMPT WITH THE VIDEO. YOU WILL DO IT BY ADDING ADDING A COMMENT TO THE SUBMITTED VIDEO. For instance:\n\nAttempt 1 →  4:34 (4 seconds and 34 milliseconds)\nAttempt 2 →  2:24 (2 seconds and 24 milliseconds)\nAttempt 3 →  1:11 (1 second and 11 milliseconds)\n\nNote that you should NOT add up the time of each attempt so that:\n\n4:34\n6:58 (4:34+2:24)\n7:69 (4:34+2:24+1:11)\n\n\n\n\nVideo Submission (Juggling or Cup Stacking)\nFollow the steps below to submit the video you recorded to fulfill the requirements of either the Update 2 or Final Video Performance assignment for the chosen skill (Juggling or Cup Stacking).\n\nRecord the video for the assignment in question (Update 2 or Final Video Performance)\nUsing a computer or tablet, open Canvas and locate the assignment in question\nClick on Start Assignment\nAttach your video to the submission and submit the assignment\n\n\n\n6.

Your paper will be returned if any of the three principles you selected is not in the list below.\nThe “stages of learning” principle, DOES NOT count as one of the three principles you will be selecting. The stages of the learning principle will be a separate section of your paper. Thus, you will be discussing 4 principles as part of your paper. The “stages of learning” (cognitive, associative, autonomous) + the 3 other principles coming from the list below.\nTake some time to study this Quizlet set to improve your knowledge of MLPs.\n\n\n\nMotor Learning Principles (MLP) you should consider when practicing the chosen skill:\n\n[CH07] speed-accuracy trade-off principle\n\nA characteristic of motor skill performance in which the speed at which a skill is performed is influenced by movement accuracy demands. The trade-off is that increasing speed yields decreasing accuracy, and vice versa.\n\n[CH09] Action-effect principle (hypothesis) - internal vs external focus\n\nThe proposition that actions are best planned and controlled by their intended effects. When related to attention focus, this hypothesis proposes that the learning and performance of skills are optimized when the performer’s attention is directed to the intended outcome of the action rather than on the movements themselves.\n\n[CH11] Encoding specificity principle\n\nA memory principle that indicates the close relationship between encoding and retrieval memory processes. It states that memory test performance is directly related to the amount of similarity between the practice and the test contexts; i.e., the more similarity, the better the test performance will be.\n\n[CH13] Transfer of learning principle - positive or negative\n\nThe influence of prior learning on the learning of a new skill or the performance of a skill in a new context.\n\n[CH14] Augmented feedback principle - concurrent, terminal, etc.\n\nA generic term used to describe information about a performance that supplements the sensory feedback and comes from a source external to the performer; it is sometimes referred to as extrinsic or external feedback.\n\n[CH14] Cognitive mediation theory (principle)\n\nA theory for explaining the benefit of a demonstration proposing that when a person observes a skilled model, the person translates the observed movement information into a cognitive code that the person stores in memory and uses when the observer performs the skill.\n\n[CH16] Practice variability principle - random vs blocked practice\n\nThe memory and performance disruption (i.e., interference) that results from performing multiple skills or variations of a skill within the context of practice.\n\n[CH17] Distribution of practice principle - Distributed vs Massed\n\nDistributed is a practice schedule in which the amount of rest between practice sessions or trials is relatively long. Massed is a practice schedule in which the amount of rest between practice sessions or trials is very short.\n\n[CH17] Overlearning\n\nA practice that continues beyond the amount needed to achieve a certain performance criterion.\n\n[CH18] Whole vs part practice principle (more info here)\n\nSkills that are high in organization and low in complexity are best served through whole practice. The part practice method generally involves breaking down the skill into natural parts or segments, practicing those parts separately until they are learned, and then integrating them to perform the skill in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, you will find the paper written by Dr. Denny in which she discusses the application of several MLPs in coaching volleyball. YOU MUST READ THE ARTICLE BELOW AND COMPLETE THE ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE ARTICLE - LT Update 3\n\nFollowing each principle, I provide my own comments.

(2010). Applying motor learning principles in coaching volleyball. Coaching Volleyball Magazine, (June/July), 24–25.\nCoaching volleyball is enhanced when coaches draw from a variety of disciplines to assist in teaching skill development. The discipline of motor learning focuses on the acquisition of motor skills and/or the improvement of motor skills and involves principles that can be implemented by coaches to aid in volleyball skill acquisition. Coaches using principles from motor learning literature will enable players to reach their full potential in learning and developing volleyball skills leading to a more effective performance on the court. The following is a two-part series, summarizing various principles from motor learning research and making applications for coaching the sport of volleyball.\n\nPrinciple #1: Encoding specificity principle (The Practice Conditions Should Be Like the Game)\nIt has been stated that if you want to learn how to play the game, then play the game. In motor learning, this is a memory principle called the “encoding specificity principle” which suggests that the more closely aligned the practice context is to the game context, the better the game performance. For volleyball coaches, this means striving to make the practice conditions as much like the game conditions as possible. For example, if you know you will be playing in a gym with a very low ceiling, practice passing balls at a lower level. If you are going to face a big middle hitter who cuts the angles in your next match, then have someone hitting those angles in practice. If you want your players to perform well during stressful games, set up similar pressure situations during practice. For example, playing loud music, making bad calls, or putting the server on the end-line to serve for game point after a long rally, are all examples of making practice more like the game. Practices would include everything and anything that could possibly be experienced during the game. As a coach, look for ways to guarantee players have already practiced everything before they actually see it in the real game, and always be analyzing practices by evaluating how well you are training your players for actual game performance.\nMy own comments:\nThe practice conditions should approximate as much as possible the test conditions. In practicing the chosen skill, consider this principle. Because you will be required to video record yourself, it is important you video record yourself a couple of times while practicing. Performers tend to get nervous when they find out they have to perform in front of other people and/or in front of the camera.\nIn addition, it is essential you are consistent when it comes to equipment and location. You must choose the equipment that will be used during practice asap.\nIf juggling is your choice, then you must decide whether to use bean bags, balls, or any other object. I strongly advise you to choose the small bean bags you can find in local toy stores or Amazon (https://goo.gl/yvaWU5).\nIf speed cup stacking is your choice, you must decide which kind of cups you will use for practice. Last time I checked, this set of cups (https://goo.gl/QrJZU9) was less than $5 on Amazon. Do NOT choose regular plastic cups as they will negatively affect your performance.\n\n\nPrinciple #2: Practice variability principle - The Practice Conditions Should Provide for Variability (blocked vs random)\nA second motor learning principle that is closely related to the encoding principle is called the “contextual interference principle” which stresses that random types of practice conditions are usually best. For example, if you are working on passing, it is best not to just practice passing from the same spot over and over again. This is called block practice and is not at all like the game of volleyball. How often does the player stand in one spot passing ten balls in a row from the same server from the same area? In random practice, the player might be asked to serve-receive 10 different types of serves from 10 different places from several different types of servers on the court. This random practice schedule best prepares passers to receive in the game. A further application would be after serve-receive, have players practice coming in for different types of sets and hits along the net with a full team coverage formation. Random practice has been proven to be effective in most situations. The only time random practice is discouraged is with beginners. For beginning players, coaches should start with a block schedule, practicing the same skill in the same way under the same condition repeatedly. The problem with most coaches, however, is that they continue this blocked practice schedule long after the athlete has acquired the basic skill pattern. Once the basic skill is demonstrated, random practice should be introduced.\nMy own comments:\nRandom practice variability is more useful when learning “open skills”. Both juggling and speed cup stacking areconsidered “closed skills”, and, therefore, requires blocked practice. With open skills, the environmental features determine when to begin the action. In basketball, for instance, when dribbling the ball toward the basket while opponents are trying to steal the ball. This is an example of “open skill” since the features of the environment are not predictable. On the other hand, the free-throw shooting in basketball is considered a “closed skill”. The features of the environment are predictable and the player decides when to initiate the action.\n\n\nPrinciple #3: Learning Occurs in Three Distinct Stages\nMotor learning is complex and consists of three distinct stages. The cognitive stage is when the learner creates a mental picture of the skill to be executed along with processing the visual, kinesthetic, and auditory cues needed for the skill. Performance during this initial stage is full of questions and errors as the learner attempts to get an idea of how to do the skill. During the second stage, called the associative stage, the learner begins to understand how to do the skill and “associates” the movement with environmental cues. This stage is sometimes called the refining stage since learners begin to narrow the motor response and identify and correct errors on their own. The final stage of motor learning is termed the autonomous stage since the performance of the skill is now automatic. At this stage the learned skill is now a habit, requiring little attention. In order to reach this highest level, many years of practice are needed, and not all performers will achieve this final stage. For coaches, it is important to identify which stage a player is present since different stages require different coaching skills. During the initial cognitive stage, appropriate and timely feedback is needed to help the novice performer understand how to do the skill and how to correct errors. The coach is providing lots of encouragement along with appropriate feedback during the cognitive stage. During the associative stage, the coach’s role shifts towards refining techniques. During this stage, the coach waits and allows the player to identify his or her own performance errors and correction. While the emphasis is on refinement, there are ample opportunities for practice to develop the consistency of the skill performance. Working with athletes in the final autonomous stage, the role of the coach again is different. Now the emphasis is on developing strategies and tactics for using the skill in a variety of game situations.\nMy own comments:\nNote that I do not consider the stages of learning as a motor learning principle per se. I treat the stages of learning as a separate section of the Reflection Paper (please refer to this assignment for more information).\n\n\nPrinciple #4: Transfer of learning principle (Consider Transfer of Learning When Teaching New Motor Skills)\nTransfer of learning is the effect previous experiences have on the learning of a new skill or performing a skill in a new context. The concept of transfer lays the foundation for all of skill learning. Transfer of learning can be positive, negative, or neutral. Volleyball coaches should be aware of the transfer of learning effect and utilize it to help with teaching new skills to players or teaching already learned skills in new contexts. Positive transfer provides the foundation for teaching skill progression. Once a skill is learned, it can be transferred to new settings, or be the foundation for new skill learning. An example of transfer would be the overhand throwing pattern. Early in a child’s development, the correct overhand pattern should be established. This skill can then be applied across different settings and into new sport skills. In volleyball the spike and jump serve both derive from the basic overhand pattern. Ensure that this fundamental skill is acquired at an early age so that positive transfer can occur later in volleyball skill learning. While positive transfer is a powerful tool, coaches should be aware of the role that negative transfer can play as well. Although negative transfer is temporary, it does initially hinder or hurt learning a new skill. In volleyball, an example of this could be when players initially learn to jump off two feet when spiking, and then the coach tries to teach the basic one-foot take-off for the slide. Since negative transfer is not permanent, the coach should be patient as players work on learning similar, but different skills.\nMy own comments:\nWhen practicing your chosen skill reflect upon previous experience acquired when practicing a similar skill. When doing so, consider whether there was a positive or negative transfer of learning when learning juggling or speed cup stacking. If so, you may discuss how such an experience affected the learning process of your chosen skill. Make sure to provide details.\n\n\nPrinciple #5: Action-effect principle (Focus Attention on the Movement Effects Rather Than Just the Movement)\nTraditionally, coaches have the athlete focus on the internal movement of skills. For example, feedback statements such as “keep your elbows locked”or “reach and snap” have been the standard performance cues used for teaching the basic skills of volleyball. While such statements focus on the movement action rather than the effects of the movement, motor learning research suggests that focusing on the external effects of movement also has a positive effect on skill acquisition. As volleyball coaches, we should explore the effectiveness of using a more external focus of attention when instructing our athletes. For example, when teaching the basic overhand serve, instead of cues such as “keep your elbow high; step forward with the opposite foot, and reach and make contact,” shift the focus to the external effects and see the results. External focus cues might include “see the ball up, step towards the target”, or “hand to the ball to the serving zone.” When providing feedback for the basic pass, teaching cues such as “keep the ball low” or “see the pass to the target” might be added with “thumbs together and lock elbows” or “lift with the legs.” An external focus enables the performer not to concentrate so much on the movement itself, but rather on the effect or outcome of the movement and is effective. Coaches always desire to enhance the performance of their athletes. Information from various disciplines such as motor learning can help assist the coach with this process.\nMy own comments:\nWhen practicing your chosen skill you could apply this PML by shifting from internal to external focus and assess whether the principle was effective. As pointed by Denny (2010), by focusing on external features of the performance learners will pay less attention to the movement itself. This is especially helpful when the learners are moving from the cognitive to the associative state of learning. When reading the content of chapter 12 (Magill & Anderson, 2017), you will realize that learners entering the Fitts and Posner second stage of learning (associative) will focus less and less on the specific movements needed to perform a given skill.\n\n\n#6 –Augmented feedback principle (Feedback is Essential for Skill Learning)\nPerhaps there is no more conclusive evidence in motor learning literature than the effectiveness of feedback to enhance skill acquisition. In addition to task intrinsic feedback, which is provided through the senses of the learner, augmented feedback provides additional information helping the learner acquire the desired skill performance. A coach providing appropriate augmented feedback to the player regarding the performance of a skill is very helpful. Augmented feedback may come in different forms such as a coach providing verbal feedback. For example, when the coach remarks, “You served 8 of 10 balls in-bounds in zone three,” this type of augmented feedback is called knowledge of results. While KR is often redundant with task intrinsic feedback, it may be needed when task intrinsic is not available or is unclear. Another type of verbal feedback is knowledge of performance. KP is when information is given regarding the specific characteristics of the performance. For example, a coach using KP informs the hitter that she dropped her elbow prior to the spike. This type of verbal information is descriptive knowledge of performance, as the feedback “describes” the act, and is recommended for more advanced players. For beginners, prescriptive KP is more effective such as telling a beginner to keep their elbow high when spiking. Besides verbal feedback, other examples of using augmented feedback include videotape recordings and movement kinematics such as the Dartfish software program.\nMy own comments:\nWhen practicing your chosen skill you should definitely incorporate this MLP into your practice. There are several ways to receive feedback while practicing and a length discussion is provided in our text. Even if you decide not to add this MLP in your reflection piece, considering it during practice will help you tremendously.\n\n\nPrinciple #7 – Augmented feedback principle (More Is Not Always Better)\nWhile feedback is extremely beneficial in skill acquisition, more is not necessarily better. In fact, asking learners to rate their own performance before providing augmented feedback may actually enhance the feedback effectiveness and help players not become so dependent on the coach providing all the feedback. There are numerous ways to decrease the amount of feedback provided, helping players become independent learners. For example, having players perform several attempts of a skill before providing augmented feedback (called summary feedback) can allow them to engage in a cognitive/kinesthetic skill analysis before hearing from the coach. A method called self-selected feedback suggests players only receive feedback from the coach when the players request feedback. Another approach of providing less rather than more feedback is termed “bandwidth feedback” which entails establishing an acceptable range or criterion of performance error, and only providing feedback once the player is outside that range. These approaches for reducing feedback delivery are helpful for coaches and players since it is a systematic reduction of feedback based on individual skill levels. So while feedback is essential for skill learning, more is not always better.\nMy own comments:\nThe principle #7, which was discussed by Denny (2010), is simply an extension of principle #6. As you will see, Magill and Anderson (2017) will address principle #6 and #7 as one single principle and call it Augmented Feedback (Chapter 15).\n\n\nPrinciple #8 – Whole vs Part practice principle (Consider Organization and Complexity When Practicing the Whole Skill or Part of the Skill)\nPerhaps no other motor learning topic is debated as much as the whole/part practice question. When practicing a volleyball skill, which type is more effective? To practice the entire skill or to practice parts of the skill? One way for volleyball coaches to solve this dilemma is to conduct a skill analysis for each of the six volleyball skills (serving, passing, setting, hitting, blocking, and digging) and determine the complexity and the organization of each skill. The complexity of the skill consists of the number of parts or components while the organization of the skill involves the relationship among the various parts. If a skill is highly organized, it means that one part is dependent on the previous components. After doing the skill’s task analysis, the general principle is if the skill is high in complexity and low in organization then the part method is better. For example, serving in volleyball would involve several components or parts to the skill, but these parts are not interdependent to one another; so the part method would be more appropriate. However, when a skill is low in complexity and high in organization practicing the whole skill is more appropriate. For example, spiking in volleyball involves parts that are highly dependent on one another. The approach, jump, and arm swing all work interdependently in order for the entire skill to be successful, thus the whole method is more appropriate, and this is especially true when working with beginners. The whole/part debate will continue among volleyball coaches, but determining the complexity and organization of the various skills may provide some guidance regarding which practice approach is better to use during practice skill instruction.\nMy own comments:\nThis is a very important principle that will help you when practicing your chosen skill. You will realize that practicing juggling as a whole will produce the best results. This is because juggling is considered high and complexity and high organization (refer to Magill & Anderson, 2017 for details). Now, some will find it helpful to practice a simplified version of the skill (a type of part practice called simplification). Practicing with scarves, for instance, is an example. Notice that you are not trying to apply the part practice to the actual characteristics of the skill of juggling (see the listed 7 characteristics in the picture below).\nNow, with the skill of speed cup stacking, one would benefit by employing the part practice method. In this case, the complexity is high but the organization is low. We break up the skill into parts and practice each part separately before practicing it as a whole. For instance, when practicing the 3-6-3 sequence, it is recommended that you practice the 3 up/down part separate from the 6 up/down part.\n\n\nPrinciple #9- Distribution of practice principle (Practices Should Be Short and Frequent)\nThis principle relates to mass versus distributed practice schedules. A mass practice schedule will have fewer practice sessions than a distributed schedule and will be fewer in number, while a distributed practice schedule will have the same amount of time allotment, but across more sessions making the sessions shorter in length. For the majority of volleyball coaches, decisions regarding the amount of practice time may or may not be within their control, but how long each practice is, and how often the team should practice are legitimate concerns that need to be addressed. The motor learning research suggests that practices can be too long and not as productive as shorter practices, so when in doubt, go for a shorter practice session, rather than a longer one. If more practice is needed, add additional practice sessions instead of lengthening the specific practice schedule.\nMy own comments:\nConsider using this PML when practicing your chosen skill. Your practice sessions should be short with some time for resting in between sessions.\n\n\nPrinciple #10- If You Want To Get Better at Playing Volleyball, Play the Game of Volleyball\nThe final motor learning principle for coaches to remember repeats the first tenant presented at the beginning of this series. Since repetition aids learning, this critical principle needs repeating; practice like the game. The best practices increase skill learning that can be transferred to the real game setting. During practice, if coaches increase time on game-related skills and increase opportunities to learn the skills in the context of the game, players will get better at playing the game of volleyball. Remember when volleyball coaches had players passing, setting, or spiking against the wall during practices. The question no one asked was “how often during the volleyball game will”passing”, “setting”, or “spiking” against the wall be necessary”? Many of our practice drills do not simulate the game conditions. It has been stated that the best passing drill is a pass/set/hit drill; the best setting drill is a pass/set/hit drill, and the best hitting drill is a pass/set/hit drill. In other words, if you want to get better at playing the game, then play the game. For volleyball coaches, this means designing drills to simulate the same skills needed in the game. If it isn’t game-like, don’t do it. Always be analyzing practices, changing drills, and incorporating mini-games, wash drills, and controlled scrimmages, so that practice looks like the game of volleyball. If you want your players to get better at playing volleyball, then let them play volleyball.\nEffective volleyball coaches work hard to enhance the performance of their players. Information from various disciplines such as motor learning can help assist them with this process. This article looked at 10 principles from motor learning literature along with applications for teaching/coaching volleyball skills. Although certainly not exhaustive of all motor learning concepts, these principles do provide a solid pedagogical foundation for coaches developing successful players and effective teams.\nMy own comments:\nRefer to principle #1"

In the early stages of learning, a significant amount of cognitive activity is needed to understand and execute the skill. As the student progresses, the cognitive demand decreases, allowing them to perform the skill more automatically.\nControl of Movement: This criterion assesses the level of conscious and automatic control over the motor skill. In the initial learning stages, students rely heavily on conscious control. As they gain experience, the control of movement transitions to being more automatic, allowing for smoother execution.\nExecution Speed: This criterion evaluates the speed at which the student can perform the motor skill. Early in the learning process, students may perform the skill slowly and hesitantly. As they become more proficient, their execution speed increases, ultimately reaching an optimal or exceptional level.\nFluidity & Efficiency: This criterion measures the smoothness, consistency, and efficiency of the student’s movements. In the beginning stages, students may struggle with fluidity and efficiency, but as they progress, their movements become more reliable and efficient, eventually reaching a superior level.\n\n\n\nLT - Update 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\n5\n3\n2\n0\nPts\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding\nDemonstration of knowledge and understanding gained from assigned reading\nComprehensive understanding, insightful analysis.\nSolid understanding, evidence of engagement.\nLimited understanding, incomplete analysis.\nNo understanding demonstrated.\n5\n\n\nResponse\nResponse to peers\nReplied to 3 other students\nReplied to 2 other students\nReplied to 1 other students\n\n5\n\n\nEmpirically based\nResponses (all posts) are based on reliable sources (e.g., Magill and Anderson) and not solely on person opinion\nConsistently uses reliable sources, well-supported responses.\nGenerally uses reliable sources, occasional personal opinions.\nLargely based on personal opinions, limited use of sources.\nConsistently relies on personal opinions, no reliable sources used.\n5\n\n\nContribution\nProvocative: Response goes beyond simply answering the prompt; attempts to stimulate further though & discussion\nSubstantial: Response provides most of the content required by the prompt, but does not require further analysis of the subject.\nSuperficial: Response provides obvious information without further analysis of the concept; lacks depth of knowledge or reasoning.\nNot acceptable:\nInformation is minimal.\n5\n\n\nAPA Style Citation\nResponsibly cited; offers example\nAll sources are consistently and correctly cited and referenced in APA format.

Early learners often struggle with precision and consistency. Still, as they progress, they develop the ability to link these elements with their performance, ultimately achieving high accuracy and consistency.\nTime: Juggling: you must juggle 3 objects continuously for at least 5 seconds. Cup Stacking: you must complete the “up and down” in under 10 seconds.\n\n\n\nLT - Reflection Paper"

If you select juggling, I suggest you to acquire the mini juggling balls, which are small and have the recommended weight for beginners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you choose to use any object other than the mini juggling balls, understand that your performance may be negatively affected by it. When performing the exchange technique (required for this activity), at a given point, performers need to hold two objects in one hand. This becomes a problem if large objects are being used; i.e., tennis balls.\n\n\n\n\nSpeed Stacks Sport Stacking Set\nIf you choose to learn the cup stacking, I recommend you to acquire the cups used in national and international tournaments, or grab a set of less expensive ones from Amazon or elsewhere.\n\nDO NOT USE ORDINARY PLASTIC CUPS WHEN PRACTICING AS THEY ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR CUP STACKING. These cups will significantly affect your performance and your grade, in case you choose cup stacking as your learning task."

Be aware that borrowing a paper from a student who completed this course previously and writing your paper based on that student’s paper will be considered PLAGIARISM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTurnitin (see below) will detect such misconducts as it checks every submission against a database of papers, as well as against the Internet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nPenalties: If caught, the student will receive a letter grade of “F” on BOTH the Reflection Paper and the Video Performance assignments, in which case the student will likely fail the course as these two assignments account for 40% of the course total grade.\n\n\nWhat is Turnitin?\nYou should be aware that the Reflection Paper will be submitted via Canvas, which is connected to Turnitin. This is an automated system that instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student’s assignment with billions of websites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit assignments through the Canvas Assignment Tool in electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as an instructor, I receive a report from Turnitin that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment."

    "section": "Appendix A",
    "text": "Appendix A\nOne of the major requirements of this course is to learn how to perform a motor skill (either Hand Juggling or Speed Cup Stacking). You will be required to practice, learn, and show proof of mastery for the selected skill by video recording your performance.\nIn addition to learning the skill of your preference, you will be required to write a reflection paper discussing your experience.\nNOTE: If you have mastered Hand Juggling and Speed Cup Stacking, contact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss alternative skills you may select to practice. Note that you may be asked to prove you have mastered both skills before you are assigned a new skill.\n\nThe choice of skill\nYou will be given the option to choose the skill to practice and learn.\nYou will learn in this course that Juggling and Cup Speed Stacking are placed under two different categories as far as motor learning is concerned. Each skill has different cognitive and motor skill demands. Juggling is categorized as a continuous skill. Continuous skills have not detectable beginning and end once the performer has started performing it. Cup Speed Stacking on the other hand is considered a discrete skill, which has a clear beginning and end. One begins by stacking up the first “three” on the left/right and ends by stacking down the opposite “three” (left/right).\nMy suggestion:\n\nWatch the demo videos below for both skills;\nPick the one that is most appealing to you;\nComplete the tutorial for the chosen skill (Appendix B);\nAcquire the proper equipment and start practicing as per the recommendations outlined in this course;\nWhen released, complete the update assignments (1, and 2);\nIf after completing the Update 2 assignment you feel the chosen skill is not for you, contact the instructor ASAP to receive permission to switch skills.\n\n\n\nHand Juggling 3 objects continuously\nHand juggling requires lots of practice, and the amount of time needed to master this motor skill will depend on a number of factors. Dedication, focus, discipline, along with the use of motor learning strategies (Motor Learning Principles) are just some of these factors.\nSome have claimed (and demonstrated) that juggling can be learned in 24 hours, or even 10 minutes.\nFor this assignment, you will be given plenty of time to learn the skill (up to 4 months if taking this course in the fall or spring).\n\nJuggling Requirements\nIf you select the skill of hand juggling to practice and learn, you will be required to:\n\nJuggle 3 objects continuously for at least 5 seconds to receive the full points under the evaluation category of TIME (refer to the evaluation rubric for this assignment). \nYou can earn 5 extra points if you continuously juggle 3 objects for at least 10 seconds (using the correct technique). \n\n\n\nThe technique\nThe “exchange continuous” technique is the only technique that will be accepted if you select the skill of juggling 3 objects. Watch the video below to have a sense of what this technique looks like.\nKIN 377 Keith Makiuchi Juggling\n\nIncorrect techniques that will NOT be accepted\nBelow are some examples of techniques that you should NOT use. Although it is possible to “juggle” using different techniques, the alternative techniques discussed below WILL NOT be accepted. If you are unsure, contact Dr. Furtado to verify if the technique you are practicing will be accepted.\n\n\n\nJuggling with a pause\nJuggling in circling motion\n\n\n\n\nSome might use this technique during the early stages of skill learning, as a practice technique. However, the videos recorded for the learning updates and the final submission should not depict this technique.\nAgain, some might use this technique during the early stages of skill learning, as a practice technique. However, the videos recorded for the learning updates and the final submission should not depict this technique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you start practicing Juggling\n\nChoose 3 objects to use when practicing this skill.\nThe only exception is that you cannot use scarves, plastic bags, or anything light that makes the “exchange” process easier. As you will see in the tutorial, scarves or plastic bags are used at the beginning of the learning process when learners need more time to think during the exchange. This is a learning technique that may be used to learn this skill, but you should NOT submit the final video (or the updates) juggling scarves or plastic bags.  \nAlthough not required, I encourage you to purchase a set of 3 mini juggling balls if you choose this skill. Amazon sells a set of 3 for about $6. Here is the link → http://goo.gl/5VHs9d\nI’ve put together a tutorial (APPENDIX B) that is meant to help you before and after you start practicing.\n\n\n\nThings to consider when practicing Juggling\n\nPractice a few hours per day. Learning a motor skill takes time and practice. Waiting until the end of the term to begin practicing is a really bad idea.\nAs you practice the skill, use the Motor Learning Principles (APPENDIX C) that will be taught in this course. For example, jugglers use the Principle of Simplification when learning to juggle 3 objects:\nThey begin by tossing a single object up with one hand and catching with the opposite hand. Then, they proceed by using 2 objects, and then 3 objects. There are many other Motor Learning Principles that can be used when learning the skill of juggling. Note that this technique SHOULD NOT be used when recording the Update or Final video performance; this technique should only be used for training purposes. \nTo earn the full points for TIME, student must juggle continuously for 5 seconds or more. The full evaluation criteria will be released soon.\n\n\n\n\nSpeed Cup Stacking\nIf you select the skill of cup stacking to practice and learn, you will be required to perform the technique called 3-6-3 (watch the video below) and finish the “up & down” at or under 10 seconds to receive full points. You can earn some extra points (up to 5 points) if you complete the 3-6-3 “up & down” at or under 5:00 seconds.\nVisit the link below for an example that depicts the technique you will be required to learn if you choose this skill:\nhttps://youtu.be/OjEH3ugV6mM\n\nBefore you start practicing Cup Stacking\n\nPurchase a set of 12 professional cups online or from a local toy store. Amazon sells a set of 12 cups for about $10 → https://goo.gl/q1kKiw\nI’ve put together a tutorial that is meant to help you before and after you start practicing: click here to access the tutorial\n\n\n\nThings to consider when practicing Cup Stacking\n\nIt is imperative that you practice a few hours per day. Learning a motor skill takes time and practice. Waiting until the end of the term to begin practicing is a really bad idea.\nAs you practice the skill, use the Motor Learning Principles that will be taught in this course. For example, learners can employ the concept of “Whole Practice vs Part Practice” when learning the skill. Instead of trying to learn the 3-6-3 (Whole Practice), one can learn the “3” and the “6” steps separately (Part Practice).\n\n\n\n\nVideo Recording for Juggling or Cup Stacking\nYou must video record yourself while performing the chosen skill. Although students are free to choose the device of their choice, using a tablet, smartphone or even a laptop\n\nA few things to consider:\n\nPick a place with decent lighting\nChoose your device; it could be your cell phone, a tablet, or even a computer \nPractice several trials while the camera is off\nWhen ready, record a sequence of THREE trials with intervals of 3 seconds in between trials.\nHere is the sequence:\n\nTurn on the camera\nPosition yourself in front of the camera (ensure your face appears on camera)\n\nWait 3 seconds ⟶ TRIAL 1 \nWait 3 seconds ⟶ TRIAL 2\nWait 3 seconds ⟶ TRIAL 3\n\nTurn off the camera; you are done!\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant notes\n\nThe recording must be done continuously. Do not pause the video, especially in between trials; nor should the recorded sequence be edited in ANY FORM - IF YOU DO, THE VIDEO WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU.\nAny submission containing a video that does not conform to the requirements of the items above will be returned to the student. Note that the “late assignment” policy will be applied in such a case (refer to our Syllabus for more info). \nThough not required, it is recommended that you ask someone to video record you as that person can move and follow you in case you move around during the performance;\nIf you juggle the object for 10 seconds (any of the 3 attempts), you may stop at 10 seconds since this is the minimum required to earn the extra points (refer to the Grading Rubrics);\nYou MUST record 3 attempts, even if you got 10 seconds on the first and/or the second attempt;\n\nI will consider your best attempt for grading purposes, not the average of the 3 attempts.\n\nDO NOT record more than 3 attempts. If you recorded 3 trials and for some reason, you are not happy with the result, you will have to start all over. ONLY submit a video that has 3 attempts.\nYou must provide the time it took you to complete each attempt. ONCE THE FINAL VIDEO IS RECORDED, WATCH IT AND USE A TIMER (CELL PHONE) TO TIME EACH ATTEMPT. WRITE IT DOWN SINCE YOU WILL NEED TO SUBMIT THE TIME IT TOOK YOU TO COMPLETE EACH ATTEMPT WITH THE VIDEO. YOU WILL DO IT BY ADDING ADDING A COMMENT TO THE SUBMITTED VIDEO. For instance:\n\nAttempt 1 →  4:34 (4 seconds and 34 milliseconds)\nAttempt 2 →  2:24 (2 seconds and 24 milliseconds)\nAttempt 3 →  1:11 (1 second and 11 milliseconds)\n\nNote that you should NOT add up the time of each attempt so that:\n\n4:34\n6:58 (4:34+2:24)\n7:69 (4:34+2:24+1:11)\n\n\n\n\nVideo Submission (Juggling or Cup Stacking)\nFollow the steps below to submit the video you recorded to fulfill the requirements of either the Update 2 or Final Video Performance assignment for the chosen skill (Juggling or Cup Stacking).\n\nRecord the video for the assignment in question (Update 2 or Final Video Performance)\nUsing a computer or tablet, open Canvas and locate the assignment in question\nClick on Start Assignment\nAttach your video to the submission and submit the assignment\n\n\n\n6. Learning Task Updates\nYou will be submitting several updates throughout the semester (a 6-week period for summer sessions). Below you will find some key information regarding these updates. To avoid surprises, be proactive, and review these assignments.\n\nUpdate 1: Cognitive stage\n\nFirst, read Chapter 12 (The Stages of Learning)\nAs you are reading, pay close attention to the characteristics associated with the first stage of learning as described by Fitts and Posner (Cognitive Stage).\nNext, select the skill you will be practicing and learning as part of the Learning Task Assignment. \nPractice the skill for 1 or 2 days (a few hours each day). You will be asked to describe how your experience reflects (or does not) Fitts & Posner description of the Cognitive Stage. Please, be specific. \n\n\n\nUpdate 2: Video update\nYou will be required to record and submit a video for UPDATE 2. The video you will be submitting must depict you performing the skill you have selected for the Learning Task Assignment. It should be apparent in the video that you have moved from the Fitts & Posner Cognitive Stage to the Associative Stage (refer to Chapter 12 for more info).\nYou must follow the instructions outlined above for video recording (Juggling and Cup Stacking) and video submission(both skills).\n\n\nUpdate 3: Principles of Motor Learning*\n*Does not apply to students taking this course during the winter.\nThis is the last update before you submit your video performance at the end of the semester (6-week period for summer sessions). You will be required to do the following:\n\nPick TWO of the Principles of Motor Learning you have been using to learn your selected motor skill (juggling or speed cut stacking).\nFor EACH, provide the following:\nThe principle’s name and definition (make sure to cite our textbook properly)\nA description of how the principle is helping you to progress through the Fitts & Posner Stages of Learning (BE SPECIFIC)\nThe hurdles you have faced when trying to employ the principle as a learning strategy (BE SPECIFIC)\n\n\n\n\nReflection Paper\nReflection Paper Template\n\nInstructions\nIn addition to performing the chosen task, you will be required to write a reflection piece describing your learning experience. You must include at least 3 Motor Learning Principles (MLP) as part of your reflection in addition to discuss the three stages of learning from Fitts and Posner (refer to Chapter 12 on our textbook). Read Appendix C for further information regarding the MLPs.\n\n\nFor the skill selected, do the following:\n\nWrite a 6-page (double-spaced) reflection paper describing your experience. As part of your reflection, you need to:\n\ndiscuss how you moved through the stages of learning (described by Fitts and Posner - Chapter 12)\ndiscuss 3 Motor Learning Principles (e.g., feedback, practice distribution, etc.) covered in this course and explain how the principles were applied to your learning experience.\n\n\n\n\nYour reflection paper must:\n\nhave a minimum of 6 FULL pages and no more than 10 pages;\nbe typed using 12-point Times New Roman font, no exceptions;\nbe typed in double space, no exceptions;\n\nNO EXTRA SPACE IN BETWEEN PARAGRAPHS AND EACH SECTION OF YOUR PAPER\n\nhave 1-inch margins on all sides\nhave a “Works Cited” page (does not count toward the 6-page minimum)\n\nShould be on a separate page. DO NOT use the reference section to “fill up” space and meet the 6-page minimum requirement\n\n\n\n\nTemplate\nI have created a template to help you with this assignment. You will be required to use the template (see link above) when writing the reflection paper. When using the template:\n\nDO NOT delete the titles (Introduction, Stages of Learning, Principle 1,…)\nDO NOT delete the page numbers. If the page #s get deleted by accident, insert them back before submitting your paper.\n\n\n\nReferencing Sources in APA Style\n\nYou MUST cite (ONLY PARAPHRASES OR DIRECT QUOTES -  40 WORDS OR LESS) ALL sources utilized and this has to be done following the APA style format. \nIMPORTANT: You will NOT be required to cite sources other than Magill and Anderson (YYYY) and/or Danny (2010). PLEASE, DO NOT CITE MY SLIDES. THE INFORMATION IN THE SLIDES WAS TAKEN FROM Magill & Anderson (2020)"

The “stages of learning” (cognitive, associative, autonomous) + the 3 other principles coming from the list below.\nTake some time to study this Quizlet set to improve your knowledge of MLPs.\n\n\n\nMotor Learning Principles (MLP) you should consider when practicing the chosen skill:\n\n[CH07] speed-accuracy trade-off principle\n\nA characteristic of motor skill performance in which the speed at which a skill is performed is influenced by movement accuracy demands. The trade-off is that increasing speed yields decreasing accuracy, and vice versa.\n\n[CH09] Action-effect principle (hypothesis) - internal vs external focus\n\nThe proposition that actions are best planned and controlled by their intended effects. When related to attention focus, this hypothesis proposes that the learning and performance of skills are optimized when the performer’s attention is directed to the intended outcome of the action rather than on the movements themselves.\n\n[CH11] Encoding specificity principle\n\nA memory principle that indicates the close relationship between encoding and retrieval memory processes. It states that memory test performance is directly related to the amount of similarity between the practice and the test contexts; i.e., the more similarity, the better the test performance will be.\n\n[CH13] Transfer of learning principle - positive or negative\n\nThe influence of prior learning on the learning of a new skill or the performance of a skill in a new context.\n\n[CH14] Augmented feedback principle - concurrent, terminal, etc.\n\nA generic term used to describe information about a performance that supplements the sensory feedback and comes from a source external to the performer; it is sometimes referred to as extrinsic or external feedback.\n\n[CH14] Cognitive mediation theory (principle)\n\nA theory for explaining the benefit of a demonstration proposing that when a person observes a skilled model, the person translates the observed movement information into a cognitive code that the person stores in memory and uses when the observer performs the skill.\n\n[CH16] Practice variability principle - random vs blocked practice\n\nThe memory and performance disruption (i.e., interference) that results from performing multiple skills or variations of a skill within the context of practice.\n\n[CH17] Distribution of practice principle - Distributed vs Massed\n\nDistributed is a practice schedule in which the amount of rest between practice sessions or trials is relatively long. Massed is a practice schedule in which the amount of rest between practice sessions or trials is very short.\n\n[CH17] Overlearning\n\nA practice that continues beyond the amount needed to achieve a certain performance criterion.\n\n[CH18] Whole vs part practice principle (more info here)\n\nSkills that are high in organization and low in complexity are best served through whole practice. The part practice method generally involves breaking down the skill into natural parts or segments, practicing those parts separately until they are learned, and then integrating them to perform the skill in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, you will find the paper written by Dr. Denny in which she discusses the application of several MLPs in coaching volleyball. YOU MUST READ THE ARTICLE BELOW AND COMPLETE THE ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE ARTICLE - LT Update 3\n\nFollowing each principle, I provide my own comments.

(2010). Applying motor learning principles in coaching volleyball. Coaching Volleyball Magazine, (June/July), 24–25.\nCoaching volleyball is enhanced when coaches draw from a variety of disciplines to assist in teaching skill development. The discipline of motor learning focuses on the acquisition of motor skills and/or the improvement of motor skills and involves principles that can be implemented by coaches to aid in volleyball skill acquisition. Coaches using principles from motor learning literature will enable players to reach their full potential in learning and developing volleyball skills leading to a more effective performance on the court. The following is a two-part series, summarizing various principles from motor learning research and making applications for coaching the sport of volleyball.\n\nPrinciple #1: Encoding specificity principle (The Practice Conditions Should Be Like the Game)\nIt has been stated that if you want to learn how to play the game, then play the game. In motor learning, this is a memory principle called the “encoding specificity principle” which suggests that the more closely aligned the practice context is to the game context, the better the game performance. For volleyball coaches, this means striving to make the practice conditions as much like the game conditions as possible. For example, if you know you will be playing in a gym with a very low ceiling, practice passing balls at a lower level. If you are going to face a big middle hitter who cuts the angles in your next match, then have someone hitting those angles in practice. If you want your players to perform well during stressful games, set up similar pressure situations during practice. For example, playing loud music, making bad calls, or putting the server on the end-line to serve for game point after a long rally, are all examples of making practice more like the game. Practices would include everything and anything that could possibly be experienced during the game. As a coach, look for ways to guarantee players have already practiced everything before they actually see it in the real game, and always be analyzing practices by evaluating how well you are training your players for actual game performance.\nMy own comments:\nThe practice conditions should approximate as much as possible the test conditions. In practicing the chosen skill, consider this principle. Because you will be required to video record yourself, it is important you video record yourself a couple of times while practicing. Performers tend to get nervous when they find out they have to perform in front of other people and/or in front of the camera.\nIn addition, it is essential you are consistent when it comes to equipment and location. You must choose the equipment that will be used during practice asap.\nIf juggling is your choice, then you must decide whether to use bean bags, balls, or any other object. I strongly advise you to choose the small bean bags you can find in local toy stores or Amazon (https://goo.gl/yvaWU5).\nIf speed cup stacking is your choice, you must decide which kind of cups you will use for practice. Last time I checked, this set of cups (https://goo.gl/QrJZU9) was less than $5 on Amazon. Do NOT choose regular plastic cups as they will negatively affect your performance.\n\n\nPrinciple #2: Practice variability principle - The Practice Conditions Should Provide for Variability (blocked vs random)\nA second motor learning principle that is closely related to the encoding principle is called the “contextual interference principle” which stresses that random types of practice conditions are usually best. For example, if you are working on passing, it is best not to just practice passing from the same spot over and over again. This is called block practice and is not at all like the game of volleyball. How often does the player stand in one spot passing ten balls in a row from the same server from the same area? In random practice, the player might be asked to serve-receive 10 different types of serves from 10 different places from several different types of servers on the court. This random practice schedule best prepares passers to receive in the game. A further application would be after serve-receive, have players practice coming in for different types of sets and hits along the net with a full team coverage formation. Random practice has been proven to be effective in most situations. The only time random practice is discouraged is with beginners. For beginning players, coaches should start with a block schedule, practicing the same skill in the same way under the same condition repeatedly. The problem with most coaches, however, is that they continue this blocked practice schedule long after the athlete has acquired the basic skill pattern. Once the basic skill is demonstrated, random practice should be introduced.\nMy own comments:\nRandom practice variability is more useful when learning “open skills”. Both juggling and speed cup stacking areconsidered “closed skills”, and, therefore, requires blocked practice. With open skills, the environmental features determine when to begin the action. In basketball, for instance, when dribbling the ball toward the basket while opponents are trying to steal the ball. This is an example of “open skill” since the features of the environment are not predictable. On the other hand, the free-throw shooting in basketball is considered a “closed skill”. The features of the environment are predictable and the player decides when to initiate the action.\n\n\nPrinciple #3: Learning Occurs in Three Distinct Stages\nMotor learning is complex and consists of three distinct stages. The cognitive stage is when the learner creates a mental picture of the skill to be executed along with processing the visual, kinesthetic, and auditory cues needed for the skill. Performance during this initial stage is full of questions and errors as the learner attempts to get an idea of how to do the skill. During the second stage, called the associative stage, the learner begins to understand how to do the skill and “associates” the movement with environmental cues. This stage is sometimes called the refining stage since learners begin to narrow the motor response and identify and correct errors on their own. The final stage of motor learning is termed the autonomous stage since the performance of the skill is now automatic. At this stage the learned skill is now a habit, requiring little attention. In order to reach this highest level, many years of practice are needed, and not all performers will achieve this final stage. For coaches, it is important to identify which stage a player is present since different stages require different coaching skills. During the initial cognitive stage, appropriate and timely feedback is needed to help the novice performer understand how to do the skill and how to correct errors. The coach is providing lots of encouragement along with appropriate feedback during the cognitive stage. During the associative stage, the coach’s role shifts towards refining techniques. During this stage, the coach waits and allows the player to identify his or her own performance errors and correction. While the emphasis is on refinement, there are ample opportunities for practice to develop the consistency of the skill performance. Working with athletes in the final autonomous stage, the role of the coach again is different. Now the emphasis is on developing strategies and tactics for using the skill in a variety of game situations.\nMy own comments:\nNote that I do not consider the stages of learning as a motor learning principle per se. I treat the stages of learning as a separate section of the Reflection Paper (please refer to this assignment for more information).\n\n\nPrinciple #4: Transfer of learning principle (Consider Transfer of Learning When Teaching New Motor Skills)\nTransfer of learning is the effect previous experiences have on the learning of a new skill or performing a skill in a new context. The concept of transfer lays the foundation for all of skill learning. Transfer of learning can be positive, negative, or neutral. Volleyball coaches should be aware of the transfer of learning effect and utilize it to help with teaching new skills to players or teaching already learned skills in new contexts. Positive transfer provides the foundation for teaching skill progression. Once a skill is learned, it can be transferred to new settings, or be the foundation for new skill learning. An example of transfer would be the overhand throwing pattern. Early in a child’s development, the correct overhand pattern should be established. This skill can then be applied across different settings and into new sport skills. In volleyball the spike and jump serve both derive from the basic overhand pattern. Ensure that this fundamental skill is acquired at an early age so that positive transfer can occur later in volleyball skill learning. While positive transfer is a powerful tool, coaches should be aware of the role that negative transfer can play as well. Although negative transfer is temporary, it does initially hinder or hurt learning a new skill. In volleyball, an example of this could be when players initially learn to jump off two feet when spiking, and then the coach tries to teach the basic one-foot take-off for the slide. Since negative transfer is not permanent, the coach should be patient as players work on learning similar, but different skills.\nMy own comments:\nWhen practicing your chosen skill reflect upon previous experience acquired when practicing a similar skill. When doing so, consider whether there was a positive or negative transfer of learning when learning juggling or speed cup stacking. If so, you may discuss how such an experience affected the learning process of your chosen skill. Make sure to provide details.\n\n\nPrinciple #5: Action-effect principle (Focus Attention on the Movement Effects Rather Than Just the Movement)\nTraditionally, coaches have the athlete focus on the internal movement of skills. For example, feedback statements such as “keep your elbows locked”or “reach and snap” have been the standard performance cues used for teaching the basic skills of volleyball. While such statements focus on the movement action rather than the effects of the movement, motor learning research suggests that focusing on the external effects of movement also has a positive effect on skill acquisition. As volleyball coaches, we should explore the effectiveness of using a more external focus of attention when instructing our athletes. For example, when teaching the basic overhand serve, instead of cues such as “keep your elbow high; step forward with the opposite foot, and reach and make contact,” shift the focus to the external effects and see the results. External focus cues might include “see the ball up, step towards the target”, or “hand to the ball to the serving zone.” When providing feedback for the basic pass, teaching cues such as “keep the ball low” or “see the pass to the target” might be added with “thumbs together and lock elbows” or “lift with the legs.” An external focus enables the performer not to concentrate so much on the movement itself, but rather on the effect or outcome of the movement and is effective. Coaches always desire to enhance the performance of their athletes. Information from various disciplines such as motor learning can help assist the coach with this process.\nMy own comments:\nWhen practicing your chosen skill you could apply this PML by shifting from internal to external focus and assess whether the principle was effective. As pointed by Denny (2010), by focusing on external features of the performance learners will pay less attention to the movement itself. This is especially helpful when the learners are moving from the cognitive to the associative state of learning. When reading the content of chapter 12 (Magill & Anderson, 2017), you will realize that learners entering the Fitts and Posner second stage of learning (associative) will focus less and less on the specific movements needed to perform a given skill.\n\n\n#6 –Augmented feedback principle (Feedback is Essential for Skill Learning)\nPerhaps there is no more conclusive evidence in motor learning literature than the effectiveness of feedback to enhance skill acquisition. In addition to task intrinsic feedback, which is provided through the senses of the learner, augmented feedback provides additional information helping the learner acquire the desired skill performance. A coach providing appropriate augmented feedback to the player regarding the performance of a skill is very helpful. Augmented feedback may come in different forms such as a coach providing verbal feedback. For example, when the coach remarks, “You served 8 of 10 balls in-bounds in zone three,” this type of augmented feedback is called knowledge of results. While KR is often redundant with task intrinsic feedback, it may be needed when task intrinsic is not available or is unclear. Another type of verbal feedback is knowledge of performance. KP is when information is given regarding the specific characteristics of the performance. For example, a coach using KP informs the hitter that she dropped her elbow prior to the spike. This type of verbal information is descriptive knowledge of performance, as the feedback “describes” the act, and is recommended for more advanced players. For beginners, prescriptive KP is more effective such as telling a beginner to keep their elbow high when spiking. Besides verbal feedback, other examples of using augmented feedback include videotape recordings and movement kinematics such as the Dartfish software program.\nMy own comments:\nWhen practicing your chosen skill you should definitely incorporate this MLP into your practice. There are several ways to receive feedback while practicing and a length discussion is provided in our text. Even if you decide not to add this MLP in your reflection piece, considering it during practice will help you tremendously.\n\n\nPrinciple #7 – Augmented feedback principle (More Is Not Always Better)\nWhile feedback is extremely beneficial in skill acquisition, more is not necessarily better. In fact, asking learners to rate their own performance before providing augmented feedback may actually enhance the feedback effectiveness and help players not become so dependent on the coach providing all the feedback. There are numerous ways to decrease the amount of feedback provided, helping players become independent learners. For example, having players perform several attempts of a skill before providing augmented feedback (called summary feedback) can allow them to engage in a cognitive/kinesthetic skill analysis before hearing from the coach. A method called self-selected feedback suggests players only receive feedback from the coach when the players request feedback. Another approach of providing less rather than more feedback is termed “bandwidth feedback” which entails establishing an acceptable range or criterion of performance error, and only providing feedback once the player is outside that range. These approaches for reducing feedback delivery are helpful for coaches and players since it is a systematic reduction of feedback based on individual skill levels. So while feedback is essential for skill learning, more is not always better.\nMy own comments:\nThe principle #7, which was discussed by Denny (2010), is simply an extension of principle #6. As you will see, Magill and Anderson (2017) will address principle #6 and #7 as one single principle and call it Augmented Feedback (Chapter 15).\n\n\nPrinciple #8 – Whole vs Part practice principle (Consider Organization and Complexity When Practicing the Whole Skill or Part of the Skill)\nPerhaps no other motor learning topic is debated as much as the whole/part practice question. When practicing a volleyball skill, which type is more effective? To practice the entire skill or to practice parts of the skill? One way for volleyball coaches to solve this dilemma is to conduct a skill analysis for each of the six volleyball skills (serving, passing, setting, hitting, blocking, and digging) and determine the complexity and the organization of each skill. The complexity of the skill consists of the number of parts or components while the organization of the skill involves the relationship among the various parts. If a skill is highly organized, it means that one part is dependent on the previous components. After doing the skill’s task analysis, the general principle is if the skill is high in complexity and low in organization then the part method is better. For example, serving in volleyball would involve several components or parts to the skill, but these parts are not interdependent to one another; so the part method would be more appropriate. However, when a skill is low in complexity and high in organization practicing the whole skill is more appropriate. For example, spiking in volleyball involves parts that are highly dependent on one another. The approach, jump, and arm swing all work interdependently in order for the entire skill to be successful, thus the whole method is more appropriate, and this is especially true when working with beginners. The whole/part debate will continue among volleyball coaches, but determining the complexity and organization of the various skills may provide some guidance regarding which practice approach is better to use during practice skill instruction.\nMy own comments:\nThis is a very important principle that will help you when practicing your chosen skill. You will realize that practicing juggling as a whole will produce the best results. This is because juggling is considered high and complexity and high organization (refer to Magill & Anderson, 2017 for details). Now, some will find it helpful to practice a simplified version of the skill (a type of part practice called simplification). Practicing with scarves, for instance, is an example. Notice that you are not trying to apply the part practice to the actual characteristics of the skill of juggling (see the listed 7 characteristics in the picture below).\nNow, with the skill of speed cup stacking, one would benefit by employing the part practice method. In this case, the complexity is high but the organization is low. We break up the skill into parts and practice each part separately before practicing it as a whole. For instance, when practicing the 3-6-3 sequence, it is recommended that you practice the 3 up/down part separate from the 6 up/down part.\n\n\nPrinciple #9- Distribution of practice principle (Practices Should Be Short and Frequent)\nThis principle relates to mass versus distributed practice schedules. A mass practice schedule will have fewer practice sessions than a distributed schedule and will be fewer in number, while a distributed practice schedule will have the same amount of time allotment, but across more sessions making the sessions shorter in length. For the majority of volleyball coaches, decisions regarding the amount of practice time may or may not be within their control, but how long each practice is, and how often the team should practice are legitimate concerns that need to be addressed. The motor learning research suggests that practices can be too long and not as productive as shorter practices, so when in doubt, go for a shorter practice session, rather than a longer one. If more practice is needed, add additional practice sessions instead of lengthening the specific practice schedule.\nMy own comments:\nConsider using this PML when practicing your chosen skill. Your practice sessions should be short with some time for resting in between sessions.\n\n\nPrinciple #10- If You Want To Get Better at Playing Volleyball, Play the Game of Volleyball\nThe final motor learning principle for coaches to remember repeats the first tenant presented at the beginning of this series. Since repetition aids learning, this critical principle needs repeating; practice like the game. The best practices increase skill learning that can be transferred to the real game setting. During practice, if coaches increase time on game-related skills and increase opportunities to learn the skills in the context of the game, players will get better at playing the game of volleyball. Remember when volleyball coaches had players passing, setting, or spiking against the wall during practices. The question no one asked was “how often during the volleyball game will”passing”, “setting”, or “spiking” against the wall be necessary”? Many of our practice drills do not simulate the game conditions. It has been stated that the best passing drill is a pass/set/hit drill; the best setting drill is a pass/set/hit drill, and the best hitting drill is a pass/set/hit drill. In other words, if you want to get better at playing the game, then play the game. For volleyball coaches, this means designing drills to simulate the same skills needed in the game. If it isn’t game-like, don’t do it. Always be analyzing practices, changing drills, and incorporating mini-games, wash drills, and controlled scrimmages, so that practice looks like the game of volleyball. If you want your players to get better at playing volleyball, then let them play volleyball.\nEffective volleyball coaches work hard to enhance the performance of their players. Information from various disciplines such as motor learning can help assist them with this process. This article looked at 10 principles from motor learning literature along with applications for teaching/coaching volleyball skills. Although certainly not exhaustive of all motor learning concepts, these principles do provide a solid pedagogical foundation for coaches developing successful players and effective teams.\nMy own comments:\nRefer to principle #1"
