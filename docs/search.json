    "text": "Basic principles\nAPA style 7th edition in-text citation refers to the way in which sources are cited within the text of a paper. In-text citations are used to give credit to the sources that were used to support the author’s ideas or arguments.\nIn APA style 7th edition, in-text citations are formatted as follows:\n\nFor a direct quote, include the author’s last name, the publication year, and the page number. For example: (Smith, 2020, p. 5)\nFor a paraphrase or summary, include the author’s last name and the publication year. For example: (Smith, 2020)\nFor 2 authors, include the last names of both authors and the publication year. For example:\n\nAccording to Smith and Jones (2020), …\n… (Smith & Jones, 2020)\n\nFor 3+ authors, include the first authors’ last name followed by et al. and the publication year. For example: (Smith, et al., 2020)\nFor sources with no author, include the title and the publication year. For example: (“Title of the Article,” 2020)\nFor sources with no date, include the author’s last name and the date the source was accessed. For example: (Smith, n.d.)\n\nExamples:\n\nAccording to Smith (2020), “the use of technology in education has increased significantly in recent years” (p. 10).\nThe study found that students who use technology in the classroom tend to have better learning outcomes (Smith, 2020).\nAccording to Smith and Jones (2020), physical activity helps memory optimization.\nThe research conducted by Smith et al. (2020) suggests that technology can be an effective tool for enhancing student engagement.\nAccording to the article “The Impact of Technology on Learning” (2020), the use of technology in education can lead to improved student achievement.\nThe study by Smith (n.d.) found that students who use technology in the classroom tend to have better learning outcomes.\n\nIt is important to note that in-text citations should be used in conjunction with a reference list at the end of the paper, where all sources cited in the text are listed in alphabetical order by author’s last name. The reference list should include all the information needed to locate the source, such as the author’s name, publication date, title, and publication details."

    "text": "Parenthetical vs. Narrative citations\nIn APA style, there are two main types of in-text citations: parenthetical and narrative.\nParenthetical citations are brief citations that are included within parentheses in the text of the paper. They include the author’s last name and the publication year. For example: (Smith, 2020).\nNarrative citations are integrated into the text of the paper, rather than being enclosed in parentheses. They include the author’s last name and the publication year. For example, according to Smith (2020), ….\nThe main difference between the two is how they are presented within the text, with Parenthetical citations appearing within the parentheses and Narrative citations being integrated into the text. Both types of citation provide the necessary information for the reader to locate the source in the reference list. It is important to note that Parenthetical citations are preferred in APA style, but the narrative citations are also acceptable as long as they are clear and consistent throughout the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor type\nParenthetical citation\nNarrative citation\n\n\n\n\nOne author\n(Furtado, 2020)\nFurtado (2020)\n\n\nTwo authors\n(Furtado & Gallagher, 2020)\nFurtado and Gallagher (2020)\n\n\nThree or more authors\n(Furtado et al., 2020)\nFurtado et al. (2020)\n\n\nOrganization\n(Quarto, 2020)\nQuarto (2020)"

    "section": "Uses of page numbers",
    "text": "Uses of page numbers\nPage numbers are an essential component of APA Style 7th edition when citing sources in academic writing. They serve a crucial function in in-text citations and reference list entries.\nIn in-text citations, page numbers allow readers to locate the exact spot within a source where the information being cited can be found. This is especially important for direct quotes and paraphrased material. Examples of in-text citations with page numbers include: (Smith, 2019, p. 27) and (Jones & Lee, 2020, pp. 45-46).\nIn reference list entries, page numbers allow readers to locate the specific pages or range of pages on which the information being cited appears. Examples of reference list entries with page numbers include:\n\nJournal article: Smith, J. D. (2019). The effects of caffeine on sleep patterns. Journal of Sleep Research, 28(3), 25-34.\nBook chapter: Jones, T. K., & Lee, S. M. (2020). The impact of technology on education. In P. Singh (Ed.), Trends and issues in education for the 21st century (pp. 45-68). Sage Publications.\n\nIn both cases, page numbers provide readers with the information they need to locate and verify the accuracy of the information being presented. When including page numbers in citations, use “p.” or “pp.” to indicate a single page or range of pages, respectively."

    "text": "Secondary sources\nIn APA style 7th edition, when citing a source that was found within another source, it is known as a “secondary source.” The in-text citation for a secondary source includes the author’s last name and the year of publication of the original source, in parentheses, followed by the page number (if applicable) where the information was found. Here is an example:\nOriginal source: Jones, T. (2020). The effects of exercise on mental health. Journal of Psychology, 55(3), 189-202.\nSecondary source: Smith, J. (2021). The benefits of regular exercise. In J. Smith, The complete guide to physical and mental wellness (pp. 45-56). New York: Random House.\nIn-text citation:\n\nAccording to Jones (2020), regular exercise has positive effects on mental health (as cited in Smith, 2021, p. 50).\nAccording to Jones (2020), cited in Smith (2021), the rise of obesity has become a growing concern.\n\nNote that in the reference list of your paper, you only need to include the original source, Jones (2020) and not the secondary source, Smith (2021)."
